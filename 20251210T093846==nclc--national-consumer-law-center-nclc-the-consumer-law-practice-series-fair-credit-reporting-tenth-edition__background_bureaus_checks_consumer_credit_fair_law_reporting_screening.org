** Fair Credit Reporting

*** Credit Bureaus, Tenant Screening, Background Checks, and Other Reports

Credit and consumer  reporting is one of today’s most  active areas of
consumer litigation, involving individual  and class cases against the
Big Three credit bureaus,  tenant screening agencies, background check
companies, and  furnishers and users  of consumer reports.  Credit and
consumer report  errors can cause  significant injury to  a consumer’s
access to credit, employment, residential rentals, and insurance.

For forty  years, NCLC's  Fair Credit Reporting  has been  the leading
treatise on  credit reporting litigation.  This tenth edition  and its
continuous digital updates keep  practitioners current with the latest
U.S. Supreme  Court rulings,  CFPB interpretations, federal  and state
legislative   changes,   government   enforcement   actions,   caselaw
developments, and changes to industry practices.
