<h3 id="org5a82ee5">Synopsis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5a82ee5">
<p>
Background: Landlord initiated unlawful detainer action against tenant, alleging she violated lease provisions requiring her to keep her apartment clean and sanitary. Tenant asserted affirmative defense of failure to reasonably accommodate her disability. After granting landlord’s request for writ of restitution and denying tenant’s request for jury trial, the Superior Court, Spokane County, Julie M. McKay, J., entered judgment for landlord. Tenant appealed.
</p>

<p>
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Pennell, J., held that:
</p>

<p>
[1] landlord’s notice of termination gave tenant sufficient opportunity to defend against landlord’s allegations;
</p>

<p>
[2] genuine issue of material facts existed to require jury trial determination as to whether landlord established basis for eviction;
</p>

<p>
[3] tenant provided sufficient facts to require jury trial on issue of landlord’s knowledge or constructive knowledge of her disability;
</p>

<p>
[4] tenant provided sufficient facts to require jury trial on issue of necessity of accommodation for her disability; and
</p>

<p>
[5] tenant provided sufficient facts to require jury trial on issue of reasonableness of the requested accommodation.
</p>

<p>
Reversed and remanded.
</p>

<p>
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Judgment.

<p>
An unlawful detainer action is a statutory proceeding that provides an expedited method of resolving the right to possession of leased property and related issues such as restitution and rent. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 59.12.010 et seq.

</ul>

<p>
Procedures set forth in the generalized unlawful detainer statute, continue to apply unless supplanted by the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (RLTA). Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §§ 59.12.010 et seq., 59.18.010 et seq.

<p>
Because the generalized unlawful detainer statute and Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (RLTA) are statutes in derogation of the common law, they are strictly construed in favor of the tenant. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §§ 59.12.010 et seq., 59.18.010 et seq.

<p>
A landlord may file an action for unlawful detainer if the tenant remains in possession of the premises in violation of the terms of the landlord’s notice to terminate tenancy. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §§ 59.12.040, 59.18.650(6)(a).

<p>
If a landlord does not convince the court at show cause hearing that it is likely to succeed in unlawful detainer action and therefore entitled to immediate possession, the court must deny writ of restitution and hold an expedited trial within 30 days. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 59.18.380.

Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (RLTA) requires any eviction notice to identify facts and circumstances known and available to landlord that support cause or causes with enough specificity so as to enable tenant to respond and prepare a defense to any incidents alleged.

<p>
Landlord’s notice of tenancy termination sufficiently apprised tenant of the facts that landlord alleged rose to level of four bases for eviction, namely, waste, nuisance, or interference with enjoyment of property, and thus gave her sufficient opportunity to defend against its allegations, as required by the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (RLTA), even if notice did not specify whether the victim of her conduct was landlord or a neighbor and, if a neighbor, which one, where information supplied to tenant made clear that landlord was relying on generally unsanitary condition of her apartment, which was conduct that could plausibly impair others’ enjoyment even when discrete victims were difficult to identify, and condition of her apartment had been extensively documented in prior notices.

Genuine issue of material facts existed to require jury trial determination as to whether landlord established a substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with its right to enjoy the property, as basis to evict tenant in unlawful detainer action, where although tenant’s apartment was significantly unkempt, there was no conclusive evidence her failure to clean the premises had tangibly damaged the property or posed imminent threat of such injury, and there was no evidence the condition of the apartment was noticeable to anyone who did not step foot into the unit.

<p>
A tenant’s claim that a landlord has failed to accommodate their disability in violation of federal and state law may constitute a defense to eviction in forcible entry action and can be asserted so long as failure to accommodate is germane to landlord’s claim to the right to possess the premises. 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 3604(f)(2), 3604(f)(3)(B); Wash.

<p>
A tenant raising failure to accommodate under federal and state law as an affirmative defense to eviction in an unlawful detainer case must show five elements: (1) they have a disability as that term is statutorily defined, (2) their landlord knew or reasonably should have known of the disability, (3) the requested accommodation may be necessary to afford the tenant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their dwelling, (4) the landlord denied the request, and (5) the requested accommodation is reasonable. 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 3604(f)(2), 3604(f)(3)(B); Wash.

<p>
*204 **838 ¶1 —Kiemle &amp; Hagood Company (K&amp;H) initiated an action for unlawful detainer against Mariam “Phoebe” Daniels, alleging she violated lease provisions requiring her to keep her apartment clean and sanitary. Ms. Daniels answered K&amp;H’s complaint by disputing the allegations and asserting an affirmative defense of failure to reasonably accommodate a disability. The trial court held a show cause hearing, after which it granted K&amp;H’s request for a writ of restitution and denied Ms. Daniels’s request for a jury trial. According to the court, trial was unwarranted because there were no substantial issues of material fact as to K&amp;H’s right to possession. As to Ms. Daniels’s reasonable accommodation defense, the trial court concluded Ms. Daniels had neither sufficiently verified she had a disability nor established the requested accommodation was necessary or reasonable.
</p>

<p>
¶2 We reverse. While there is no dispute that K&amp;H was entitled to a writ of restitution, material issues of fact precluded the trial court from issuing final judgment. Ms. *205 Daniels raised genuine issues of fact regarding whether she was subject to eviction on the grounds properly alleged by K&amp;H. Furthermore, Ms. Daniels was not required to supply third-party verification of her disability or her need for accommodation, based on the obviousness of the condition. This matter should have been set for trial rather than summarily resolved.
</p>

<p>
BACKGROUND
</p>

<p>
The parties’ lease
</p>

<p>
¶3 Phoebe Daniels leased an apartment from K&amp;H. She began with an 11-month lease term expiring in May 2021. The parties later agreed to a lease renewal, set to expire on February 28, 2022. The lease required Ms. Daniels to keep her apartment “clean and sanitary.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 22, 65. Addendums regarding mold and bed bugs contemplated specific cleaning routines, including removing clutter, vacuuming, and dusting. The lease also required Ms. Daniels to properly dispose of garbage “at least weekly.” Id.
</p>

<p>
K&amp;H’s notices to Ms. Daniels
</p>

<p>
¶4 On August 24, 2020, K&amp;H issued the first of seven notices to Ms. Daniels, alleging she had violated her cleaning obligations. Four of the notices demanded Ms. Daniels comply with her lease conditions or vacate. See id. at 101, 106, 111, 116. Two of the notices directed her to cure the lease violations or the landlord would enter the property and conduct remedial work at cost. See id. at 122, 127. The final notification directed Ms. Daniels to quit and vacate the premises. See id. at 134.
</p>

<p>
¶5 Each notice provided detailed descriptions, citing recent inspections by K&amp;H employees. According to the notices, furniture and boxes were stacked inside Ms. Daniels’s residence, blocking ingress and egress; garbage had not been disposed of; spills and dirty paper towels had accumulated on the floor; and there was an excessive amount of *206 personal property throughout the unit, including in the kitchen and bathroom, and in proximity to heating fixtures and on the stovetop.
</p>

<p>
¶6 Two of K&amp;H’s notices were issued on November 3, 2021.1 One was entitled “Ten (10) Day Notice to Comply or Vacate.” Id. at 116. The other was entitled, “Notice to Cure Lease Non-Compliance.” Id. at 127. The former notice stated Ms. Daniels had 10 days to comply or her rental agreement would end; the latter stated she had 10 days to cure or the landlord could enter the apartment and perform remedial work at cost to Ms. Daniels.
</p>

<p>
1
</p>

<p>
One of the November 3 notices expressly “supersede[d] any previous notice.” CP at 131.
</p>

<p>
¶7 The seventh and final notice was issued on December 27, 2021. See id. at 134. This one was entitled “Notice to Quit and Vacate Due to Nuisance, Waste, and/or Unlawful Activity.” Id. This notice stated Ms. Daniels had until January 2, 2022, to vacate her apartment. The notice was longer than the previous notices and referenced the prior **839 notices to cure. The December 27 notice also advised that on November 29, 2021, the landlord had conducted an inspection of Ms. Daniels’s apartment and found it had still not been cleaned. The December 27 notice stated if Ms. Daniels did not vacate the premises by January 2, she would be deemed in unlawful detainer and K&amp;H would initiate legal action. The December 27 notice also advised Ms. Daniels of her right to legal representation.
</p>

<p>
K&amp;H files suit
</p>

<p>
¶8 Ms. Daniels did not vacate her unit, and on January 10, 2022, K&amp;H initiated an unlawful detainer action. K&amp;H’s complaint alleged two independent causes for eviction. First, that Ms. Daniels was in “ ‘substantial breach’ ” of her tenant obligations. Id. at 13 (quoting RCW 59.18.650(2)(b)). Second, that Ms. Daniels had committed “ ‘waste,’ ” “ ‘nuisance,’ ” “ ‘unlawful activity that affects the *207 use and enjoyment of the premises,’ ” or “ ‘other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or neighbors.’ ” Id. at 13-14 (quoting RCW 59.18.650(2)(c)). K&amp;H also requested a writ of restitution restoring it to possession of the premises pending the unlawful detainer action. The trial court scheduled a show cause hearing. Ms. Daniels obtained appointed counsel, answered the complaint and asserted affirmative defenses, and filed a motion to dismiss. Ms. Daniels’s answer argued that if the court did not dismiss K&amp;H’s complaint, factual issues remained that “ ‘must be resolved at trial.’ ” Id. at 188 (quoting Hous. Auth. v. Pleasant, 126 Wn. App. 382, 392, 109 P.3d 422 (2005)).
</p>

<p>
Ms. Daniels’s accommodation request
</p>

<p>
¶9 Just before filing her answer, affirmative defenses, and motion to dismiss, Ms. Daniels’s attorney sent a letter to counsel for K&amp;H. The letter stated Ms. Daniels generally denied the allegations set forth in K&amp;H’s complaint. But to the extent she was in violation of her tenant duties, the letter explained it was due to disability. Ms. Daniels formally requested she be given an accommodation to allow her “to continue her tenancy and avoid homelessness.” Id. at 172.
</p>

<p>
¶10 Ms. Daniels’s accommodation request stated she was 80 years old and suffered from several physical disabilities, including “degenerative disc disease, thyroid disease, high blood pressure, hypoglycemia, and incontinence.” Id. at 173. She also claimed to have lost eight inches of height in recent years: while she used to stand five feet, two inches tall, Ms. Daniels currently stood four feet, six inches. As a result of Ms. Daniels’s conditions, she had limited strength and tired easily. The accommodation request explained that when Ms. Daniels moved into her apartment, the movers did not unpack any of her belongings, and Ms. Daniels lacked the strength to do so herself. Ms. Daniels lived alone and had no family in the area to help her. Ms. Daniels explained that *208 her physical limitations hindered her ability to perform basic housekeeping tasks and that she could not afford to hire help.
</p>

<p>
¶11 The accommodation request reported Ms. Daniels intended to work with her attorney to find resources to assist her with housekeeping and unpacking her belongings. The request asked K&amp;H to “rescind the eviction notices” and “dismiss the unlawful detainer action,” which would “give [Ms. Daniels] time to obtain assistance in addressing [K&amp;H’s] concerns.” Id. at 172. The request cited Ms. Daniels’s disability, along with state and federal law prohibiting housing discrimination against persons with disabilities. It also served as a basis for one of Ms. Daniels’s affirmative defenses to K&amp;H’s complaint.
</p>

<p>
Trial court proceedings
</p>

<p>
¶12 The trial court denied Ms. Daniels’s motion to dismiss and proceeded to the show cause hearing. At the outset of the hearing, K&amp;H’s counsel informed the court that his client had denied Ms. Daniels’s request for accommodation. The hearing took place over the course of two days and involved testimony from three K&amp;H employees, a pest control technician, and Ms. Daniels.
</p>

<p>
¶13 The K&amp;H employees authenticated photographs of Ms. Daniels’s apartment; corroborated allegations that had been set forth in the notices; and explained the condition of Ms. Daniels’s unit posed a risk to the landlord **840 in the form of potential for infestation, damage to surfaces, inadequate airflow, and egress from the unit. K&amp;H’s maintenance technician opined that the condition of Ms. Daniels’s apartment posed a risk of mold growth but admitted he had not actually observed mold in the unit. The employees also testified Ms. Daniels had told them about having “back issues” that made it difficult for her to move items in her apartment. Rep. of Proc. (RP) (Feb. 14, 2022) at 66; see also id. at 86-87, 94; RP (Feb. 15, 2022) at 121.
</p>

<p>
¶14 The pest control technician testified he visited Ms. Daniels’s apartment during August 2021. At that time, the *209 overwhelming accumulation of personal items in Ms. Daniels’s unit made it “next to impossible to do an adequate pest inspection.” RP (Feb. 14, 2022) at 47. He did not opine that there was a current infestation, but testified he found rodent droppings and, due to how messy the apartment was, he was unable to find access points where rodents could enter. “I[t] wasn’t a safe environment to move around in.” Id.
</p>

<p>
¶15 Ms. Daniels testified on her own behalf and explained how her impairments diminished her strength and caused her to tire easily, impeding her ability to clean the apartment, regularly dispose of trash, and unpack boxes. During her testimony, Ms. Daniels addressed some of the specifics regarding the state of her apartment. She reiterated that the company that had moved her into the apartment had not helped her unpack. According to Ms. Daniels, the movers “stacked &#x2026; boxes three high on two walls of [the] apartment.” RP (Feb. 15, 2022) at 127. Ms. Daniels could not move the boxes “because they were too heavy.” Id. Ms. Daniels explained there was clothing on her floor because a closet rod broke and she was unable to fix it. Ms. Daniels also explained that her incontinence problem leads to an increase in the amount of garbage she produces, and that she had difficulty opening the garbage dumpster at the complex on her own. On cross-examination, Ms. Daniels conceded the condition of her apartment was unacceptable from a cleanliness standpoint. She also agreed her apartment was “in poor condition.” Id. at 158.
</p>

<p>
¶16 The trial court not only granted K&amp;H’s request for issuance of a writ of restitution but issued the landlord final judgment, finding Ms. Daniels had failed to properly clean and maintain the premises as alleged. The court found there had been “substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord, not necessarily other tenants.” RP (Feb. 22, 2022) at 210. The trial court did not find waste or nuisance, concluding there were unresolved issues of fact. *210 With respect to Ms. Daniels’s affirmative defense regarding her disability, the court concluded that K&amp;H was entitled to “third party verification” of Ms. Daniels’s disability and need for accommodation and that Ms. Daniels’s requested accommodation was “not reasonable in light of [her] past conduct.” CP at 215, 218.
</p>

<p>
¶17 The court issued an order and judgment granting issuance of a writ of restitution, restoring K&amp;H to possession of the premises, and a final judgment. See id. at 219-27. Ms. Daniels moved for reconsideration, reiterating her argument that summary resolution of K&amp;H’s suit was improper because genuine issues of material fact remained. Reconsideration was denied and Ms. Daniels filed a timely appeal.
</p>

<p>
THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCESS
</p>

<p>
[1] [2] [3]¶18 An unlawful detainer action is a statutory proceeding that provides an expedited method of resolving the right to possession of leased property and related issues such as restitution and rent. 4105 1st Ave. S. Invs., LLC v. Green Depot Wash. Pac. Coast, LLC, 179 Wn. App. 777, 785, 321 P.3d 254 (2014). Washington’s unlawful detainer process is set forth in chapter 59.12 RCW and the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 (RLTA), chapter 59.18 RCW. Residential tenancies are governed by the RLTA. However, the procedures set forth in chapter 59.12 RCW, the generalized unlawful detainer statute, continue to apply unless supplanted by the RLTA. Randy Reynolds &amp; Assocs. v. Harmon, 193 Wn.2d 143, 156, 437 P.3d 677 (2019). Because chapter 59.12 RCW and the RTLA “are statutes in derogation of **841 the common law,” they are “strictly construed in favor of the tenant.” Id.
</p>

<p>
¶19 Before initiating an unlawful detainer action, a residential landlord must first issue a written notice to terminate the tenancy that must be served consistent with RCW 59.12.040. See RCW 59.18.650(6)(a). The notice must also *211 “[i]dentify the facts and circumstances known and available to the landlord at the time of the issuance of the notice that support the cause or causes with enough specificity so as to enable the tenant to respond and prepare a defense to any incidents alleged.” RCW 59.18.650(6)(b).
</p>

<p>
¶20 Permissible grounds for termination of a residential tenancy are set forth in RCW 59.18.650(2). Two such grounds are relevant here. A tenant may be evicted for “substantial breach” of a material lease obligation, so long as the tenant is given 10 days to cure. RCW 59.18.650(2)(b). Eviction may also be premised on “waste,” “nuisance,” “unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises,” or “other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or neighbors of the tenant,” so long as the tenant is given at least 3 days’ notice to quit. RCW 59.18.650(2)(c).
</p>

<p>
¶21 Where a landlord’s notice specifies a tenant has an opportunity to cure a statutory violation or nonconformance with a lease obligation, the notice “expire[s] after sixty days unless the landlord pursues any remedy under” the RLTA. RCW 59.18.190.
</p>

<p>
[4] [5]¶22 A landlord may file an action for unlawful detainer if the tenant remains in possession of the premises in violation of the terms of the landlord’s notice. See Randy Reynolds, 193 Wn.2d at 156. To physically evict the tenant, “a landlord may apply for a writ of restitution at the same time as commencing the action or at any time thereafter.” Id. at 157. Under the RLTA, the court will not enter an order directing the issuance of a writ of restitution without first conducting a show cause hearing. RCW 59.18.370-.380.
</p>

<p>
[6] [7]¶23 A show cause hearing is a summary proceeding to determine the question of possession pending suit; it is not a final determination of the parties’ rights. Randy Reynolds, 193 Wn.2d at 157 (quoting Carlstrom v. Hanline, 98 Wn. App. 780, 788, 990 P.2d 986 (2000)). “At the show *212 cause hearing, the court will determine if the landlord is entitled to a writ of restitution before a trial on the complaint and answer.” id. (citing RCW 59.18.380). This opportunity for immediate temporary relief makes the show cause process similar to a preliminary injunction proceeding. See Faciszewski v. Brown, 187 Wn.2d 308, 315 n.4, 386 P.3d 711 (2016).
</p>

<p>
[8] [9] [10]¶24 A show cause hearing is a summary proceeding, but it is also fairly substantial. At the hearing, “[t]he court shall examine the parties and witnesses orally to ascertain the merits” of the case. RCW 59.18.380. The rules of evidence apply. Pleasant, 126 Wn. App. at 392. The court may restore the landlord to possession at the close of the hearing if it appears the landlord will likely prevail on the merits. See Webster v. Litz, 18 Wn. App. 2d 248, 250, 252-53, 491 P.3d 171 (2021) (citing RCW 59.18.380). However, if the landlord does not convince the court that it is likely to succeed and therefore entitled to immediate possession, the court must deny the writ of restitution and hold an expedited trial within 30 days. See Meadow Park Garden Assocs. v. Canley, 54 Wn. App. 371, 373-74, 773 P.2d 875 (1989) (citing former RCW 59.18.380 (1973)).
</p>

<p>
[11] [12]¶25 Even if a landlord convinces the court of a likelihood of success on the merits and obtains a writ of restitution, trial may still be necessary. See IBF, LLC v. Heuft, 141 Wn. App. 624, 634-35, 174 P.3d 95 (2007); see also Webster, 18 Wn. App. 2d at 256 (noting the issue of possession pending trial “is entirely distinct from the final resolution” of the parties’ rights). There is a distinction between possession and the right to possession. Pleasant, 126 Wn. App. at 387. Similar to the summary judgment context, if a tenant raises “a genuine issue of &#x2026; material fact” pertaining to a defense against eviction, the case must go to trial, even if the tenant has **842 temporarily lost possession pursuant to a writ of restitution. RCW 59.18.380; see also Faciszewski, 187 Wn.2d at 315 n.4. The right to trial is by jury unless waived. RCW 59.12.130.
</p>

<p>
*213 ANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
Operative notices
</p>

<p>
¶26 The parties dispute which presuit notices remained viable at the time K&amp;H initiated the unlawful detainer action on January 10, 2022. According to K&amp;H, suit was based on the November 3 notice to comply or vacate and the December 27 notice to quit and vacate. Ms. Daniels counters that the November 3 notice expired after 60 days pursuant to RCW 59.18.190. Thus, the only operative notice was the one issued on December 27. We agree with Ms. Daniels.
</p>

<p>
¶27 Under RCW 59.18.190, a notice giving a tenant the opportunity to remedy nonconformance with a rental requirement expires after 60 days “unless the landlord pursues any remedy under” the RLTA during that time period. The November 3 notice to comply or vacate stated Ms. Daniels was in violation of her lease obligations and gave her 10 days to remedy her nonconformance. Thus, RCW 59.18.190 was applicable and K&amp;H was required to pursue a remedy within 60 days.
</p>

<p>
¶28 K&amp;H argues it acted on the November 3 notice within 60 days because it issued a notice to quit and vacate on December 27. K&amp;H appears to claim that issuing a notice to quit and vacate is a remedy under the RLTA. We disagree with this assessment.
</p>

<p>
¶29 A “remedy” is generally defined as something “a court can do for a litigant who has been wronged.” DOUGLAS LAYCOCK &amp; RICHARD L. HASEN, MODERN AMERICAN REMEDIES: CASES AND MATERIALS 1 (5th ed. 2019). The most common remedies are damages and injunctions. Id.; see also BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1547 (11th ed. 2019) (A “remedy” is a means of enforcing rights or redressing wrongs through legal or equitable relief.).
</p>

<p>
[13]¶30 Under the RLTA, the remedies a court may provide to a party include recovery of possession, related damages, *214 and attorney fees. See RCW 59.18.290. The RLTA recognizes a landlord’s remedy to independently resolve certain tenant-caused defects in a rental unit at cost to the tenant, so long as there has first been adequate notice. See RCW 59.18.180(1). However, landlords are not authorized to engage in self-help evictions. See Gray v. Pierce County Hous. Auth., 123 Wn. App. 744, 757, 97 P.3d 26 (2004) (“[N]o landlord &#x2026; may ever use nonjudicial, self-help methods to remove a tenant.”).
</p>

<p>
[14]¶31 A landlord’s service of a notice to terminate a tenancy is not a remedy. It is a legal prerequisite to avail oneself of the superior court’s jurisdiction. See Hall v. Feigenbaum, 178 Wn. App. 811, 819, 319 P.3d 61 (2014). Because K&amp;H did not pursue a remedy under the RLTA within 60 days of providing Ms. Daniels with a notice to cure or vacate under RCW 59.18.650(2)(b), the November 3 notice expired. The only notice still operative by the time K&amp;H filed suit on January 10, 2022, was the one dated December 27, 2021.
</p>

<p>
Sufficiency of the December 27 notice
</p>

<p>
¶32 The December 27 notice was issued pursuant to RCW 59.18.650(2)(c),2 which allows a landlord to terminate a tenancy with three days’ notice based on “waste,” “nuisance,” “unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises,” or “other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or neighbors of the tenant.”
</p>

<p>
2
</p>

<p>
The notice also cited RCW 59.18.650(2)(b), which authorizes a landlord to terminate a tenancy based on a “substantial breach” of a material lease term. However, subsection (2)(b) requires a tenant be given 10 days to cure their noncompliance. Because the December 27 notice did not provide such a cure period, it cannot fairly be read as invoking subsection (2)(b). See Christensen v. Ellsworth, 162 Wn.2d 365, 372, 173 P.3d 228 (2007) (noting the time and manner requirements of notice demand strict compliance). Thus, subsection (2)(c) was K&amp;H’s only viable cause for eviction.
</p>

<p>
¶33 As recounted above, the December 27 notice was quite lengthy. It cited all four bases for termination under *215  **843 RCW 59.18.650(2)(c). It also included a detailed summary of Ms. Daniels’s tenancy, including recitations of the other six notices that had been issued since August 24, 2020.
</p>

<p>
¶34 Ms. Daniels criticizes the December 27 notice as both over- and underinclusive. According to Ms. Daniels, the notice should not have included all four bases for eviction under subsection (2)(c), and instead should have clarified which of the four bases K&amp;H was relying on. Ms. Daniels also complains the notice should have included an identification of who was injured by her alleged misconduct, be it a specific neighboring tenant or the landlord. We disagree with these criticisms.
</p>

<p>
[15] [16] [17]¶35 A challenge to the adequacy of notice presents a mixed question of law and fact, reviewed de novo. Hall, 178 Wn. App. at 819. Washington courts require landlords to strictly comply with timing and manner requirements of notice. Id. at 818. But when it comes to form and content, substantial compliance is sufficient. Marsh-McLennan Bldg., Inc. v. Clapp, 96 Wn. App. 636, 640 n.1, 980 P.2d 311 (1999). In terms of substance, RCW 59.18.650(6)(b) requires any notice under subsection (2) of the statute to “[i]dentify the facts and circumstances known and available to the landlord &#x2026; that support the cause or causes with enough specificity so as to enable the tenant to respond and prepare a defense to any incidents alleged.” (Emphasis added.) The critical question here is whether the landlord’s notice provided enough facts to allow Ms. Daniels to “effectively rebut the conclusion reached” by K&amp;H. Hous. Auth. v. Pyrtle, 167 Ga. App. 181, 182, 306 S.E.2d 9 (1983); see Swords to Plowshares v. Smith, 294 F. Supp. 2d 1067, 1072 (N.D. Cal. 2002) (“[N]otice must enable [a] tenant to prepare a defense or rebuttal evidence &#x2026;.”).3
</p>

<p>
3
</p>

<p>
The “specificity” requirement in RCW 59.18.650(6)(b), effective since May 2021, has not yet been interpreted by an appellate court. Ms. Daniels points out that federal regulations governing evictions from federally subsidized projects impose a comparable requirement. See 24 C.F.R. § 247.4(a)(2) (“The landlord’s determination to terminate the tenancy shall &#x2026; state the reasons for the landlord’s action with enough specificity so as to enable the tenant to prepare a defense &#x2026; .” (emphasis added)). Given the scarcity of Washington authority on point, we may look to foreign cases interpreting such federal regulations, such as Pyrtle and Swords to Plowshares, for guidance. See In re Welfare of Colyer, 99 Wn.2d 114, 119, 660 P.2d 738 (1983).
</p>

<p>
*216 ¶36 We disagree with Ms. Daniels that K&amp;H should have been clearer regarding the four bases for eviction set forth in RCW 59.18.650(2)(c). A fair reading of the notice is that K&amp;H believed Ms. Daniels may have violated any of the four statutory clauses, while recognizing that only one such violation would be necessary to terminate her tenancy. Moreover, the real question regarding notice is whether Ms. Daniels understood the factual allegations against her. See Tacoma Rescue Mission v. Stewart, 155 Wn. App. 250, 255, 228 P.3d 1289 (2010); see also RCW 59.18.650(6)(b) (requiring landlords to “[i]dentify &#x2026; facts and circumstances,” rather than legal causes of action, with “specificity” (emphasis added)). Here, it was abundantly clear K&amp;H sought to evict Ms. Daniels because she failed to keep her apartment clean and sanitary, as documented by the various inspections of her property and repeated notices to cure. K&amp;H’s notice sufficiently apprised Ms. Daniels of the facts that K&amp;H alleged rose to the level of waste, nuisance, or interference with enjoyment of the property. We do not fault K&amp;H for including all four components of RCW 59.18.650(2)(c) in its notice.4
</p>

<p>
4
</p>

<p>
Nor are we persuaded by Ms. Daniels’s argument that the notice’s use of slashes and the phrase “and/or” rendered it impermissibly vague. Cf. Batchelor v. Madison Park Corp., 25 Wn.2d 907, 924-25, 172 P.2d 268 (1946).
</p>

<p>
¶37 Ms. Daniels also argues the notice to quit was insufficiently specific as to whose rights were allegedly being interfered with by her conduct. An eviction can be justified under RCW 59.18.650(2)(c) based on “substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or neighbors of the tenant.” But, as noted by Ms. Daniels, K&amp;H’s notice did not specify whether the victim of Ms. Daniels’s conduct was the landlord or a neighbor and, if a neighbor, which one.
</p>

<p>
*217 **844 [18]¶38 We disagree that identification of a specific victim was necessary to provide Ms. Daniels sufficient notice under RCW 59.18.650(2)(c). To be sure, in some cases, identifying victims is logically necessary to afford a tenant a meaningful ability to rebut allegations, such as where the tenant’s purportedly violative conduct is alleged threats, harassment, or violence directed at specific people. See, e.g., Swords to Plowshares, 294 F. Supp. 2d at 1068 n.1; Tacoma Rescue Mission, 155 Wn. App. at 256-57; Harris v. Paris Hous. Auth., 632 S.W.3d 167, 173 (Tex. App. 2021). But here, the information supplied to Ms. Daniels made clear that K&amp;H was relying on the generally unsanitary condition of her apartment, conduct that could plausibly impair others’ enjoyment even when discrete victims are difficult to identify. See Tacoma Rescue Mission, 155 Wn. App. at 257 (faulting landlord for failing to name in notice the individuals who reported tenant’s excessive noise and threats); see also Midland Mgmt. Co. v. Helgason, 241 Ill. App. 3d 899, 911, 913, 608 N.E.2d 643, 181 Ill.Dec. 570 (1993) (notice sufficient where it apprised tenant they were being evicted for allowing “careless leakage of water”), rev’d on other grounds, 158 Ill.2d 98, 630 N.E.2d 836, 196 Ill.Dec. 671 (1994). And the condition of Ms. Daniels’s apartment had been extensively documented in prior notices, as referenced in the December 27 notice. See Martinez v. Hous. Auth., 264 Ga. App. 282, 286-87, 590 S.E.2d 245 (2003) (The notice was sufficiently specific where it cited the tenant’s “ ‘history of lease violations and warnings’ ” and referred to those prior warnings.). K&amp;H’s notice therefore gave Ms. Daniels a sufficient opportunity to defend against its allegations.
</p>

<p>
Whether the court should have ordered a trial
</p>

<p>
¶39 The parties debate whether Ms. Daniels was entitled to a trial at the conclusion of the show cause hearing. As previously explained, while a show cause hearing resolves the preliminary question of who is entitled to possession of the premises during suit, it does not necessarily resolve *218 questions regarding the ultimate right to possession or other remedies. Randy Reynolds, 193 Wn.2d at 157. Even if a landlord obtains preliminary success through a writ of restitution, trial on the right of possession must be ordered if the tenant raises genuine issues of material fact pertaining to a defense or setoff. RCW 59.18.380.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>K&amp;H’s proof of grounds for eviction</li>
</ol>

<p>
¶40 Pursuant to the December 27 notice, K&amp;H alleged at the show cause hearing that Ms. Daniels was subject to eviction under RCW 59.18.650(2)(c). This provision provides four possible bases for eviction: (1) waste, (2) nuisance, (3) unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises, and (4) substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or neighbors. The trial court issued judgment under the fourth clause of RCW 59.18.650(2)(c). This is the only basis for eviction that K&amp;H defends on appeal. We therefore focus our review on whether Ms. Daniels should have been afforded a trial on this allegation.
</p>

<p>
¶41 The standard of review governing this inquiry is not well developed. In the recent case of Tedford v. Guy, Division Two of this court stated we review a trial court’s decision on whether to order a trial for abuse of discretion. 13 Wn. App. 2d 1, 16, 462 P.3d 869 (2020). But Tedford’s statement does not draw from the language of the applicable statute, nor is it based on Supreme Court precedent. It is not binding on us. See In re Pers. Restraint of Arnold, 190 Wn.2d 136, 154, 410 P.3d 1133 (2018). The wording of the applicable statute indicates a tenant is entitled to a trial so long as they raise a “genuine issue” of “material fact.” RCW 59.18.380. This is nearly the identical language that governs summary judgment. See CR 56(c). We review summary judgment orders de novo. Staples v. Allstate Ins. Co., 176 Wn.2d 404, 410, 295 P.3d 201 (2013). Thus, it appears something close to de novo review should *219 apply, at least when a tenant denies the landlord’s grounds for eviction or raises an affirmative defense.5
</p>

<p>
5
</p>

<p>
The statute indicates a trial is proper if “there is a genuine issue of a material fact pertaining to a legal or equitable defense or set-off.” RCW 59.18.380 (emphasis added). A tenant’s legal defense might be a claim that the landlord’s basis for eviction is untrue. See, e.g., Webster, 18 Wn. App. 2d at 256-57. Or the tenant may have an affirmative defense that admits the landlord’s allegations, but nevertheless claims a right of possession. See, e.g., Josephinium Assocs. v. Kahli, 111 Wn. App. 617, 621, 45 P.3d 627 (2002). Either way, the statute suggests the tenant has a right to a trial if the tenant has raised a genuine issue of material fact.
</p>

<p>
**845 ¶42 Ms. Daniels disputes that her conduct substantially or repeatedly and unreasonably interfered with K&amp;H’s use and enjoyment of the premises. She makes two arguments. We address each in turn.
</p>

<p>
[19]¶43 First, Ms. Daniels notes that the RLTA defines “premises” as property “held out for the use of tenants.” RCW 59.18.030(22). Thus, she argues that in order for a tenant’s conduct to interfere with a landlord’s “use and enjoyment of the premises,” the landlord must also be a tenant. RCW 59.18.650(2)(c) (emphasis added). We disagree. Ms. Daniels’s proposed reading of the statute strains its text. See White v. Salvation Army, 118 Wn. App. 272, 279, 75 P.3d 990 (2003) (statutes are construed to avoid absurd results). Just because a landlord holds out their premises for the use of others does not mean the landlord abandons their own right or ability to enjoy their property. See Rental Hous. Ass’n v. City of Seattle, 22 Wn. App. 2d 426, 452-53, 512 P.3d 545 (2022) (Out-of-possession landlords retain a property interest protected by due process principles.). A landlord may enjoy their property as an investment free from unreasonable risk. By failing to keep an apartment in a clean and sanitary condition, a tenant may interfere with their landlord’s right to a secure investment, insofar as they risk permanent damage to the apartment or disturbances to the landlord’s other tenants.
</p>

<p>
¶44 Second, Ms. Daniels argues genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether her conduct was a sufficiently severe interference with K&amp;H’s use and enjoyment *220 of the property. We note that RCW 59.18.650(2)(c)’s phrase “unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises,” echoes a common definition of “nuisance.” See Moore v. Steve’s Outboard Serv., 182 Wn.2d 151, 155, 339 P.3d 169 (2014) (“[A]n activity is a nuisance only when it ‘interferes unreasonably with other persons’ use and enjoyment of their property.’ ”) (quoting Tiegs v. Watts, 135 Wn.2d 1, 13, 954 P.2d 877 (1988)) (plurality opinion))). However, RCW 59.18.650(2)(c)’s use of this terminology must be distinct from the concept of nuisance, since subsection (2)(c) also lists “nuisance” as a separate basis for eviction. See State v. K.L.B., 180 Wn.2d 735, 742, 328 P.3d 886 (2014) (Statutes ordinarily must not be read in a manner that leaves any portion meaningless or superfluous.). We interpret RCW 59.18.650(2)(c)’s reference to “interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises” as referring to either “substantial or repeated and unreasonable” conduct that approximates a nuisance, even if the steep standard for a nuisance claim is not quite met.
</p>

<p>
[20]¶45 Reasonableness is typically a question of fact, but a court can resolve a question of reasonableness “as a matter of law where reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion.” Lakey v. Puget Sound Energy, Inc., 176 Wn.2d 909, 924, 296 P.3d 860 (2013). Here, K&amp;H’s evidence of interference with its enjoyment of the apartment was not so strong that it could lead to only one conclusion. The evidence certainly revealed Ms. Daniels’s apartment was significantly unkempt. However, there was no conclusive evidence her failure to clean the premises had tangibly damaged the property or posed an imminent threat of such injury. There was evidence of some rodent droppings, but Ms. Daniels testified that those did not evidence a recent infestation because she had quelled any problem with mice after the first four months of her tenancy. Nor was there evidence the condition of her apartment was noticeable to anyone who did not step foot into the unit.
</p>

<p>
[21]¶46 We disagree with the trial court’s determination that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to *221 whether K&amp;H had established substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with its right to enjoy the property. Trial is required. As recognized by the trial court’s oral ruling, **846 there are also issues of fact as to other components of RCW 59.18.650(2)(c). Thus, the issue at trial will be whether K&amp;H can establish any grounds for eviction under RCW 59.18.650(2)(c).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Affirmative defense—failure to accommodate</li>
</ol>

<p>
¶47 Apart from challenging K&amp;H’s proof of its basis for eviction, Ms. Daniels raised an affirmative defense based on federal and state antidiscrimination law. Specifically, Ms. Daniels asserted she is disabled due to her age, infirmity, and back conditions. According to Ms. Daniels, her disability impaired her ability to remedy the problems giving rise to K&amp;H’s grounds for eviction. Ms. Daniels requested K&amp;H accommodate her disability by dismissing the current proceedings and giving her time to work with her attorney to find resources to help her clean and declutter the apartment.
</p>

<p>
[22] [23]¶48 Both federal and state law prohibit landlords from discriminating against disabled tenants, including the failure to reasonably accommodate a tenant’s disability.6 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2), (3)(B); RCW 49.60.222(1)(f), (2)(b). A tenant’s claim that a landlord has failed to accommodate their disability may constitute a defense to eviction. Josephinium Assocs. v. Kahli, 111 Wn. App. 617, 626, 45 P.3d 627 (2002). The defense can be asserted so long as the failure to accommodate is germane to the landlord’s claim to the right to possess the premises. Id.
</p>

<p>
6
</p>

<p>
The federal and Washington provisions requiring reasonable accommodation in housing are “virtually identical.” Wash. State Hum. Rts. Comm’n v. Hous. Auth., 21 Wn. App. 2d 978, 987, 509 P.3d 319 (2022). Because the Washington and federal statutes are analogous, authority interpreting the federal statute properly informs our interpretation of both provisions. Cf. Kumar v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 180 Wn.2d 481, 491, 325 P.3d 193 (2014).
</p>

<p>
[24]¶49 A tenant raising failure to accommodate as an affirmative defense must show five elements: (1) they have *222 a “disability” as that term is statutorily defined, (2) their landlord “knew or reasonably should have known” of the disability, (3) the requested accommodation “ ‘may be necessary’ to afford [the tenant] an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling,” and (4) the landlord denied the request. Giebeler v. M&amp;B Assocs., 343 F.3d 1143, 1147 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Cal. Mobile Home Park Mgmt. Co., 107 F.3d 1374, 1380 (9th Cir. 1997)). Further, the tenant is not entitled to their requested accommodation unless it is (5) “reasonable.” Id. at 1148.
</p>

<p>
¶50 The evidence here readily supports the possibility of a jury verdict for Ms. Daniels on the first and fourth elements. Ms. Daniels has presented evidence—in the form of medical records and sworn testimony—that she has medical conditions constituting a disability. And K&amp;H undisputedly denied Ms. Daniels’s requested accommodation. Thus, the parties’ dispute centers on whether Ms. Daniels sufficiently showed K&amp;H knew or reasonably should have known about her disability, whether her disability is related to the grounds for unlawful detainer asserted by K&amp;H, and whether Ms. Daniels’s requested accommodation was reasonable.
</p>

<p>
a. Landlord’s knowledge or constructive knowledge of tenant’s disability
</p>

<p>
¶51 The trial court ruled in K&amp;H’s favor as to the knowledge element on the basis that Ms. Daniels did not provide third-party verification of her disability. But such verification is not invariably required. While Washington’s Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW, requires an interactive verification process in the employment context, see RCW 49.60.040(7)(d), there is no similar mandate in the housing context. Guidance from the United States Department of Justice and United States Department of Housing and Urban Development states:
</p>

<p>
If a [tenant]’s disability is obvious, or otherwise known to the [landlord], and if the need for the requested accommodation is *223 also readily apparent or known, then the [landlord] may not request any additional information about the [tenant’s] disability or the disability-related need for the accommodation.
</p>

<p>
JOINT STATEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS **847  UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT 12-13 (May 17, 2004) (Joint Statement) (emphasis added), <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2010/12/14/joint_statement_ra.pdf">https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2010/12/14/joint_statement_ra.pdf</a> [<a href="https://perma.cc/SG47-BGKG">https://perma.cc/SG47-BGKG</a>].7 Similarly, the Washington State Human Rights Commission has also recognized that “[i]f a person has a visible disability and their request is reasonably tied to their disability, then no further verification is needed.” Disability in Housing, Wash. St. Hum. Rts. Comm’n, <a href="https://www.hum.wa.gov/fair-housing/disability-housing">https://www.hum.wa.gov/fair-housing/disability-housing</a> (emphasis added) (last. visited Apr. 27, 2023).
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The Joint Statement is a policy statement, rather than an authoritative interpretation, but it has been recognized as persuasive authority. See, e.g., Bhogaita v. Altamonte Heights Condo. Ass’n,, 765 F.3d 1277, 1286 n.3 (11th Cir. 2014); Sabal Palm Condos. of Pine Island Ridge Ass’n, v. Fischer, 6 F. Supp. 3d 1272, 1286 (S.D. Fla. 2014); Douglas v. Kriegsfeld Corp., 884 A.2d 1109, 1120, 1122 (D.C. 2005); Andover Hous. Auth. v. Shkolnik, 443 Mass. 300, 309 n.14, 820 N.E.2d 815 (2005); Kuhn v. McNary Ests. Homeowners Ass’n., Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1142, 1149 (D. Or. 2017). K&amp;H does not disagree that the Joint Statement should be referenced as persuasive authority. See Br. of Resp’t at 45.
</p>

<p>
[25]¶52 We agree with Ms. Daniels and amicus curiae the Attorney General of Washington that third-party verification of a tenant’s disability is unwarranted when a tenant’s disability is obvious or otherwise known to the landlord.
</p>

<p>
[26]¶53 Ms. Daniels has presented ample evidence of an obvious disability that was known to her landlord. Not only did Ms. Daniels testify that she told K&amp;H employees about the disability to her back but it would be obvious to anyone who looked at her that she had a physical impairment. Although she was not required to do so, Ms. Daniels voluntarily furnished medical records in which her physician *224 described her as “markedly kyphotic”8 along with noting several other physical impairments. Def.’s Ex. 2, at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, multiple K&amp;H employees testified they knew Ms. Daniels had problems with her back because she had told them as much. WLAD broadly defines “impairment” to include any “condition &#x2026; affecting” an individual’s “musculoskeletal” system. RCW 49.60.040(7)(c)(i). And an “impairment” is a “disability” when it is “perceived to exist whether or not it exists in fact.” RCW 49.60.040(7)(a)(iii). Ms. Daniels’s back problems readily meet this definition, and K&amp;H’s employees were aware of them.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
“Kyphosis” is “abnormal backward curvature of the spine.” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1258 (1993).
</p>

<p>
b. Necessity of tenant’s requested accommodation
</p>

<p>
[27]¶54 The trial court also concluded Ms. Daniels should have provided third-party verification of the connection between her disability and her requested accommodation. We recognize there are cases where a landlord may require verification of the nexus between a tenant’s disability and the requested accommodation, even if the disability itself is obvious. See Joint Statement at 13. But this case is not one where verification was necessary. K&amp;H’s allegations against Ms. Daniels included concerns that she failed to unpack boxes, did not remove garbage, and did not regularly clean. No specialized knowledge is needed to understand that an elderly person with significant back problems may have trouble engaging in these tasks. And Ms. Daniels expressly premised her requested accommodation—a discontinuation of the eviction proceedings—on the fact that such a discontinuation would give her time to find resources to help her with those tasks.
</p>

<p>
¶55 The facts were sufficient to require a jury trial on the issue of the necessity of Ms. Daniels’s requested accommodation.
</p>

<p>
*225 c. Reasonableness of tenant’s requested accommodation
</p>

<p>
[28] [29]¶56 K&amp;H argues that even if it knew of Ms. Daniels’s disability and the connection between her disability and requested accommodation, the trial court should be affirmed because Ms. Daniels has not raised a material issue of fact regarding the reasonableness of her accommodation request. Generally, the reasonableness of an accommodation is a question of fact demanding case-by-case scrutiny. See Jankowski Lee &amp; Assocs. v. Cisneros, 91 F.3d 891, 896 (7th Cir. 1996). And questions of fact are usually proper jury **848 issues. Lascheid v. City of Kennewick, 137 Wn. App. 633, 642, 154 P.3d 307 (2007). However, a trial court may resolve reasonableness as a matter of law if reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion. Boyle v. Leech, 7 Wn. App. 2d 535, 539, 436 P.3d 393 (2019). “An accommodation is reasonable &#x2026; if it does not cause a ‘fundamental alteration in the nature of a [landlord’s] program’ or ‘undue financial and administrative burdens.’ ” Josephinium Assocs., 111 Wn. App. at 623 (quoting Groner v. Golden Gate Gardens Apts.,, 250 F.3d 1039, 1044 (6th Cir. 2001)).
</p>

<p>
[30]¶57 Ms. Daniels’s accommodation request was that K&amp;H stop the eviction proceedings to give her time to work with her attorney to find services to help clean her apartment. Other courts have recognized that a request for “additional time to clean” can constitute a reasonable request. McGary v. City of Portland, 386 F.3d 1259, 1261, 1264, 1269-70 (9th Cir. 2004); see Douglas v. Kriegsfeld Corp., 884 A.2d 1109, 1120 (D.C. 2005) (recognizing brief stay in eviction proceedings to allow additional time for disabled tenant to conduct cleaning could constitute a reasonable accommodation); see also Andover Hous. Auth. v. Shkolnik, 443 Mass. 300, 311-12, 820 N.E.2d 815 (2005) (rejecting the idea that “indefinite” requests for more time are reasonable but acknowledging that delaying the typical eviction timetable can *226 constitute a reasonable accommodation where “no neighbors [are] seriously disturbed by the tenants’ behavior”).
</p>

<p>
[31]¶58 Furthermore, we note that a reasonable accommodation may be requested up until the date of physical eviction. See Radecki v. Joura, 114 F.3d 115, 116 (8th Cir. 1997); Douglas, 884 A.2d at 1121 (“[A] reasonable accommodation defense will be timely until the proverbial last minute.”). This is consistent with landlords’ obligation to reasonably make accommodations to not only their “rules” but also their “policies, practices, or services.” RCW 49.60.222(2)(b) (emphasis added); see Douglas, 884 A.2d at 1127.
</p>

<p>
¶59 We recognize that halting this unlawful detainer action would have imposed a burden on K&amp;H.9 But those burdens should have been weighed—by a jury—against the benefit to Ms. Daniels. See Josephinium Assocs., 111 Wn. App. at 623-24; Marthon v. Maple Grove Condo. Ass’n, 101 F. Supp. 2d 1041, 1051 (N.D. Ill. 2000).
</p>

<p>
9
</p>

<p>
Ms. Daniels contends that even if K&amp;H found Ms. Daniels’s requested accommodation vague, objectionable, or flatly unreasonable, K&amp;H should have engaged Ms. Daniels in a dialogue to seek clarification or explore other possible solutions. We acknowledge there is a split among legal authorities on whether such a dialogue is required by the relevant statutes or merely encouraged. See Joint Statement at 7 (explaining that landlords “should” open a dialogue with tenants who propose an unreasonable accommodation, and that if there is an alternative accommodation that would meet a tenant’s needs, the landlord “must” grant it); compare Howard v. HMK Holdings, LLC, 988 F.3d 1185, 1193-94 (9th Cir. 2021), and Groner, 250 F.3d at 1047, with Douglas, 884 A.2d at 1122 &amp; n.22, 1143-44, and Jankowski Lee &amp; Assocs., 91 F.3d at 896. At this juncture, we decline to endorse either side of this split because we conclude the reasonableness of Ms. Daniels’s accommodation should have reached a jury either way.
</p>

<p>
¶60 For the reasons set forth above, Ms. Daniels has presented sufficient facts to allow a jury to decide whether her requested accommodation was reasonable. This affirmative defense was prematurely rejected.
</p>

<p>
ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS
</p>

<p>
¶61 Ms. Daniels asks for an award of attorney fees, up to and costs, citing RCW 59.18.290 and RAP 18.1. This request is premature. If Ms. Daniels ultimately prevails on remand, *227 she may request attorney fees, to and including fees and costs associated with her appeal. See Faciszewski, 187 Wn.2d at 324.
</p>

<p>
CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
¶62 The trial court prematurely issued final judgment in favor of K&amp;H after granting the request for writ of restitution at the show cause hearing. Because there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Ms. Daniels is subject to eviction under RCW 59.18.650(2)(c) and, alternatively, whether she was entitled to a reasonable accommodation based on a disability, this matter should have been set for trial.
</p>

<p>
**849 ¶63 The final judgment in favor of K&amp;H is reversed. This matter is remanded for trial, consistent with the terms of this opinion.
</p>

Background: Landlord brought unlawful detainer action against tenants. Tenants counterclaimed for relocation assistance and raised defenses of setoff and breach of implied warranty of habitability. Following a bench trial, the Superior Court, King County, Judith H. Ramseyer, J., found that landlord had breached implied warranty and awarded damages and relocation assistance to tenants. Landlord appealed.
</p>

<p>
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Spearman, C.J., held that:
</p>

<p>
[1] evidence was sufficient to establish that landlord breached implied warranty of habitability;
</p>

<p>
[2] tenants provided landlord with notice and opportunity to cure defects in rental unit;
</p>

<p>
[3] tenants were entitled to relocation assistance;
</p>

<p>
[4] tenants were entitled to offset pre-paid rent against unpaid rent;
</p>

<p>
[5] evidence supported finding that rental unit’s habitability had been reduced by 25%;
</p>

<p>
[6] landlord was not entitled to charge tenants late fees for holdover tenancy.
</p>

<p>
Affirmed.
</p>

<p>
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal.

Tenants were entitled to raise counterclaim for relocation assistance in landlord’s unlawful detainer action; issue of right to possession was intimately tied to lawful status of the unit and tenants’ right to relocation assistance, relocation assistance claim was based on facts that would excuse tenants’ breach because it required finding that the dwelling was or would be unlawful to occupy, and excluding relocation assistance claim from unlawful detainer proceedings would undermine the goals of the relocation assistance statute.

SPEARMAN, C.J.
</p>

<p>
{{*821}} ¶ 1 Landlord Lang Pham brought this unlawful detainer action against tenants Shakia Morgan and Shawn Corbett (Tenants). The Tenants counterclaimed for relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085 and raised defenses of setoff and breach of implied warranty of habitability. The trial court found that Pham had breached the implied warranty and awarded damages and relocation assistance to the Tenants. Pham appeals, disputing the trial court’s findings of fact, the Tenants’ entitlement to damages, and their right to bring counterclaims in an unlawful detainer action. Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the trial court.
</p>

<p>
{{*822}} FACTS
</p>

<p>
¶ 2 Lang Pham purchased the residential property located at 9312 51st Avenue South, Seattle, Washington (Property) at a foreclosure sale in March 2012. Pham owns and rents other apartment buildings. The Property was metered for five living units, so Pham had assumed it met regulatory requirements for use as a fiveplex. But the Property was permitted only for use as a triplex. Renting the building as a fiveplex violated city land use and building codes. Pham repainted, installed new carpet, and refinished the floors, but did not verify the building’s permit status before renting the five units. The permit information could easily have been accessed through the King County assessor and the website of the city of Seattle, Department of Planning and Development (City).
</p>

<p>
¶ 3 On April 25, 2012, Pham and Shawn Corbett and Shakia Morgan entered into a one-year lease agreement for unit 5 (Unit) of the Property, for May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013. The Tenants were required to pay $850 rent on the first of each month. They paid the first and last month’s rent and a security deposit of $650, for a total of $2,350.
</p>

<p>
¶ 4 The tenancy presented a number of difficulties. The Tenants’ income varied and they often paid their rent late or in installments. They complained to Pham about the Unit’s conditions, including the absence of baseboards, holes and gaps between the floor, walls, and doors, lack of railings on an outside deck and stairs, leaking water/sewage in a large “crawl space,” and the stench of sewage coming from the bathroom sink. Pham characterized the Tenants’ complaints as “playing this game” and arising only when rent was due. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) at 64–65; 68. In contrast, the Tenants said that Pham would tell them to address the issues themselves, or would fail to address their concerns at all.
</p>

<p>
¶ 5 In August 2012, the Tenants notified Pham that they had seen a rat in the Unit. Pham hired an exterminator to {{*823}} inspect and treat the Property for rodents and insects on a quarterly basis. The exterminator came twice to spray and set traps. Because the exterminator did not see evidence of rats, {{**218}} Pham discontinued the scheduled quarterly visits and opted for annual visits. The Tenants continued to see and hear rats in the Unit, and caught several rats using traps they purchased and placed themselves.
</p>

<p>
¶ 6 The Tenants had paid rent in full through April 2013, when the lease expired. The lease provided that the Tenants would be liable for rent and other damages sustained as a result of any holdover. The Tenants did not make any subsequent rent payments and were still in possession of the Unit at the time of trial in July 2013. Because the Tenants did not make payment or payment arrangements for May 2013, Pham testified that he posted and mailed a three-day pay or vacate notice on May 6, 2013, but the Tenants denied receiving it.
</p>

<p>
¶ 7 On May 10, 2013, the Tenants filed a complaint with the City regarding the Unit’s conditions. Five days later, city housing and zoning inspector Tom Bradrick, inspected the Unit. Bradrick found that “the overall quality of the installation of the unit was very poor and would never have passed a building inspection at that time&#x2026;.” VRP at 114.
</p>

<p>
¶ 8 On May 16, 2013, the day after the inspection, Pham served the Tenants with another three-day pay or vacate notice. The next day Bradrick mailed a notice of violation to Pham’s home address notifying him that the Property was not permitted for use as a fiveplex and that he needed to take corrective action by June 30, 2013.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Pham testified that he did not receive this letter until May 22, 2013, five days later.
</p>


<p>
{{*824}} ¶ 9 On Monday, May 20, 2013, Pham filed an unlawful detainer action to evict the Tenants because they failed to comply with the May 16, 2013 pay or vacate notice.
</p>

<p>
¶ 10 Bradrick sent a follow up letter on Wednesday, May 22, 2013, notifying Pham that the Property must be brought into compliance or the City would require him to pay relocation assistance of $2,000.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> The letter also advised Pham that multiple repairs would be required before permitting the Unit, and that the sewage leak would need to be repaired immediately.
</p>


<p>
¶ 11 On June 6, 2013, Bradrick sent Pham a third letter listing specific repairs that needed to be done in order to obtain a permit and pass a housing inspection. These repairs included the sewage leak, the absence of a P-trap in the vanity drain under the bathroom sink, and the rodent access to the crawl space and bedroom closet. The letter again instructed Pham that if he did not make the necessary repairs, he would need to discontinue renting the Unit and pay $2,000 in relocation assistance. Pham hired an architect to work on permitting the Property for use as a fiveplex. At the time of trial, because Pham was still waiting to find out whether such use would be permittable, none of the other repairs had been made.
</p>

<p>
¶ 12 A bench trial was held on July 17, 2013. The parties presented testimony from five witnesses: Pham, Eric Bittenbender from Paratex Pest Control, Bradrick, Morgan, and Corbett. The trial court found that the Unit’s habitability had been reduced by 25 percent for the nine-month period in which the Tenants lived with the sewer and rodent issues. The trial court determined that the Tenants had {{*825}} overpaid rent for that period, but also that they owed rent because they remained in the Unit for two additional months without paying. The Tenants were awarded a net amount of $637.50 for the habitability claim, $2,550.00 in relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085 and $650.00 for {{**219}} their security deposit. The trial court denied Pham’s motion for reconsideration and awarded attorney’s fees to the Tenants. Pham appeals.

Substantial evidence exists when there is a sufficient quantity of evidence to persuade a fair-minded, rational person that a finding is true.” Hegwine v. Longview Fibre Co., Inc., 132 Wash.App. 546, 555–56, 132 P.3d 789 (2006) (citations omitted). A reviewing court begins with a presumption in favor of the trial court’s findings and the appellant has the burden of showing that a finding of fact is not supported by substantial evidence. Green v. Normandy Park Riviera Section Comm. Club, Inc., 137 Wash.App. 665, 689, 151 P.3d 1038 (2007). Unchallenged findings are verities on appeal. Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v.

</p>

<p>
Counterclaims in an Unlawful Detainer Action
</p>

<p>
¶ 14 Pham argues that the Tenants cannot bring counterclaims for relocation assistance and for damages for breach of implied warranty of habitability in an unlawful {{*826}} detainer proceeding.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> The Tenants argue that these claims are equitable defenses that directly relate to the issue of possession and, if proved, would excuse a breach of lease.
</p>


<p>
[6] <a id="org14e5243"></a> [7] <a id="orged357a0"></a> ¶ 15 Pham correctly cites the rule that counterclaims are not allowed in unlawful detainer actions, except for those “ ‘based on facts that would excuse a tenant’s breach.’ ” Br. of Appellant at 19, (quoting Josephinium Assoc. v. Kahli, 111 Wash.App. 617, 625, 45 P.3d 627 (2002).) The exception properly applies when resolution of the counterclaim is “necessary to determine the right of possession.” First Union Mgmt., Inc. v. Slack, 36 Wash.App. 849, 854, 679 P.2d 936 (1984).
</p>

<p>
¶ 16 Under this exception, Washington courts have permitted counterclaims for breach of warranty of habitability and breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wash.2d 22, 32, 515 P.2d 160 (1973); Income Props. Inv. Corp. v. Trefethen, 155 Wash. 493, 284 P. 782 (1930). The Foisy court approved of the affirmative defense of breach of warranty of habitability, because it “goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action&#x2026;.” 83 Wash.2d at 31–32, 515 P.2d 160. Pham claims that the Foisy standard is “limited to the diminution in rental value” only, not claims for damages, but cites no authority for this argument. Br. of Appellant at 21. On the contrary, Foisy is often cited as the authority allowing counterclaims for damages for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. See Munden v. Hazelrigg, 105 Wash.2d 39, 41, 711 P.2d 295 (1985), Angelo Prop. Co., LP v. Hafiz, 167 Wash.App. 789, 811–812, 274 P.3d 1075 (2012); Heaverlo v. Keico Indus., Inc., 80 Wash.App. 724, 729, 911 P.2d 406 (1996). Furthermore, RCW 59.18.400 enables a tenant to “assert any legal or equitable defense or set-off arising out of the tenancy.” We reject Pham’s arguments and {{*827}} hold that the Tenants are permitted to raise the defense of breach of warranty of habitability in this action.
</p>

<p>
[8] <a id="orga00be1b"></a> [9] <a id="org7971f48"></a> [10] <a id="org36db135"></a> [11] <a id="org0fe1145"></a> ¶ 17 We also find that the Tenants’ claim for relocation assistance was properly raised in this action. An unlawful detainer action is a limited statutory proceeding to resolve the right to possession between the landlord and the tenant. Chapter 59.12 RCW; Munden, 105 Wash.2d at 45, 711 P.2d 295. The law draws a distinction between possession and the right of possession. {{**220}} Kessler v. Nielsen, 3 Wash.App. 120, 126, 472 P.2d 616 (1970). Once an unlawful detainer action is commenced and the defendant does not concede the right to possession, he or she has the right to have the issue determined. Housing Auth. of City of Pasco and Franklin Cty. v. Pleasant, 126 Wash.App. 382, 389, 109 P.3d 422 (2005).
</p>

<p>
[12] <a id="org6f1eaaa"></a> [13] <a id="org1dba629"></a> [14] <a id="orgcee4b53"></a> ¶ 18 Pham argues that the trial court “fail[ed] to explain how relocation assistance relates to possession of the property.” Br. of Appellant at 21. And he claims it is contradictory for a tenant to ask for assistance to vacate while he or she continues to assert a right to possession. We disagree. By seeking relocation assistance, the Tenants do not concede the right to possession. Instead, they claim the right has been compromised by the Unit’s unlawful status, which, in turn, gives rise to the claim for relocation assistance. Thus, the issue of the right to possession is intimately tied to the lawful status of the Unit and the Tenants’ right to relocation assistance. Furthermore, the relocation assistance claim is also based on facts that would excuse a tenant’s breach, because it requires a finding that the dwelling is or will be unlawful to occupy. A landlord would be precluded from renting a dwelling that was illegal to occupy, and any tenants would be absolved of their duty to pay rent.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
[15] <a id="org06c798b"></a> {{*828}} ¶ 19 The Tenants also argue that excluding relocation assistance claims from unlawful detainer proceedings would undermine the goals of the statute. We find this argument persuasive. The legislature’s stated purpose when it enacted RCW 59.18.085 was to prevent tenants from being forced to “remain[ ] in rental housing that does not meet the state’s minimum standards for health and safety because they cannot afford to pay the costs of relocation in advance of occupying new, safe, and habitable housing.” See RCW 59.18.085, LAWS OF 2005 ch. 364, § 1. Requiring displaced tenants to bring separate actions for relocation assistance on the regular civil calendar would impose unnecessary delay and costs on top of the financial burdens involved in the moving process. In accordance with the statute’s purpose, we hold that an unlawful detainer action is an appropriate forum for relocation assistance claims under RCW 59.18.085.
</p>

<p>
Implied Warranty of Habitability
</p>

<p>
[16] <a id="orge5d350f"></a> ¶ 20 Pham claims that the trial court’s finding of breach of the implied warranty of habitability is not supported by substantial evidence. He argues that the sewer leak did not present a habitability issue or, if it did, he was not notified or given opportunity to cure. He also argues that there was no evidence of a rodent infestation. The Tenants argue that the record contains sufficient evidence to show that Pham breached the implied warrant of habitability.
</p>

<p>
[17] <a id="orgcc064f1"></a> [18] <a id="org5fe7823"></a> [19] <a id="orgbe5d883"></a> [20] <a id="org8e2924d"></a> ¶ 21 In a residential unlawful detainer action, a tenant may raise a defense based on a landlord’s breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Foisy, 83 Wash.2d at 32, 515 P.2d 160. {{*829}} For a breach of this warranty, the trier of fact must find “(1) Whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant’s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord’s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability.” Id. at 34, 515 P.2d 160. A warranty’s applicability is a mixed question of law and fact.  {{**221}} Burbo v. Harley C. Douglass, Inc., 125 Wash.App. 684, 694, 106 P.3d 258 (2005). Conditions that “present a substantial risk of future danger” will give rise to a claim for breach of warranty of habitability. Westlake View Condo. Ass’n. v. Sixth Ave. View Partners, LLC., 146 Wash.App. 760, 771, 193 P.3d 161 (2008).
</p>

<p>
[21] <a id="org3f2dbfd"></a> ¶ 22 The record contains ample evidence of conditions in the Unit that would cause a fair-minded, rational person to find a substantial risk of future danger. As long as substantial evidence supports the trial court’s findings, “a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court even though it might have resolved a factual dispute differently.” Sunnyside, 149 Wash.2d at 879–80, 73 P.3d 369. Pham misstates the evidence when he claims that Bradrick testified that “the habitability issues were not so egregious as to warrant an order of condemnation, eviction or displacement, even though he had authority to issue such orders.” Reply Brief at 11. Bradrick testified that he did not consider the sewer leak to be “egregious to the point where I was going to get excited and create an emergency on it or anything, but I did want it to be addressed relatively quickly.” VRP at 115. He further testified that “[i]f I went back to inspect today, and the sewage had not been rectified, I would immediately put out an emergency order, yes.” VRP at 132. The Tenants also testified about the sewage leak and smell and presented evidence that Pham had been informed that the lines needed to be replaced. The Tenants’ testimony about the persistence of rodents as well as Bradrick’s testimony and letter, all supported a likelihood that rodents were present. Bradrick also testified about the {{*830}} poor condition and installation of the stairs and handrails, back door, sewer pipe, door to the crawl space, and bathroom sink, and dangerous electrical violations. We find that the record contains sufficient evidence to support a finding of breach of the warranty of habitability.
</p>

<p>
[22] <a id="org9350599"></a> ¶ 23 Pham argues the Tenants failed to provide him with notice and opportunity to cure any defects as required by RCW 59.18.070. Br. of Appellant at 11. The argument is without merit. The record shows that Pham had ample notice of the defects and an opportunity to cure them. In addition to the complaints from the Tenants, Pham received at least three letters from Bradrick advising him of the defects. Pham presented no evidence that to the extent he acted in response to these complaints, the defects were ever cured.
</p>

<p>
[23] <a id="org00ee8f8"></a> ¶ 24 Pham argues that the trial court applied the wrong standard when it found him in breach of the implied warranty of habitability. He contends the trial court erroneously required him to take “ ‘all reasonable measures’ ” to ensure that the unit was rodent-free because the Tenants had a small child. Br. of Appellant at 12–13. In support of this argument Pham points to the court’s oral ruling, in which, quoting Landis, it stated “ ‘[t]here is no doubt that a rodent infestation can create an actual or potential safety hazard’ ” and that this was “ ‘especially true where, as here, an infant is in the home.’ ” CP at 85. The trial court also stated that Pham “had a responsibility to take all reasonable measures to keep rats from the unit, which he failed to do.” Id. But the trial court’s written findings show that its conclusion was based on the totality of the circumstances, including the sewage leak, the rats, the odors, the faulty handrails, the holes in the floor, and Pham’s failure to remedy any of the conditions.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> A written {{*831}} order controls over any apparent inconsistency with the court’s earlier oral ruling. Shellenbarger v. Brigman, 101 Wash.App. 339, 346, 3 P.3d 211 (2000). Accordingly, we reject Pham’s argument that the trial court relied on an improper standard of habitability when it {{**222}} concluded that he breached the implied warranty of habitability.
</p>


<p>
Award of Relocation Assistance
</p>

<p>
[24] <a id="org53a019a"></a> ¶ 25 Pham argues that the trial court erred in finding that the Tenants were entitled to relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085(3). Pham’s first argument is one of statutory interpretation. He argues that the Tenants are not entitled to relocation assistance because the City never issued a “notice of condemnation, eviction or displacement order.” Br. of Appellant at 17. The Tenants argue that an order is not required because the obligation to provide relocation assistance arose when Pham was notified that the dwelling was unlawful.
</p>

<p>
¶ 26 This court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo. State v. Wentz, 149 Wash.2d 342, 346, 68 P.3d 282 (2003). In interpreting statutes, we strive to discern and implement the Legislature’s intent. State v. J.P., 149 Wash.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003). Where the plain language of a statute is unambiguous, and “the legislative intent is apparent &#x2026; we will not construe the statute otherwise.” Id. (citing State v. Wilson, 125 Wash.2d 212, 217, 883 P.2d 320 (1994)). Plain meaning, however, may be gleaned “from all that the Legislature has said in the statute and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question.” Dep’t of Ecology v. Campbell &amp; Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wash.2d 1, 11, 43 P.3d 4 (2002).
</p>

<p>
¶ 27 Pham bases his argument on RCW 59.18.085(3)(c)’s reference to a “notice of the condemnation, {{*832}} eviction, or displacement order.”<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> Amicus King County Bar Association (KCBA) argues that the obligation to pay relocation assistance under subsection (3)(a) does not require that a unit actually be condemned or unlawful to occupy. It is enough for an agency to notify a landlord that the dwelling will be condemned or will be unlawful to occupy.
</p>


<p>
¶ 28 We agree with the Tenants and KCBA. The plain language of RCW 59.18.085(3) supports this interpretation. Subsection 3(a) applies when a landlord has been notified that the dwelling will be condemned or unlawful to occupy due to conditions that violate applicable codes, statutes, ordinances, or regulations. At that point, a landlord who knew or should have known of the conditions shall be required to pay relocation assistance, unless the conditions are a result of illegal activity, natural disaster, or acquisition by eminent domain. RCW 59.18.085(3)(i)-(iii).
</p>

<p>
¶ 29 If a landlord refuses to pay relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085(3)(a) and the governing agency is forced to condemn the dwelling, then the enforcement mechanisms in subsections (3)(c), (f), (g), and (h) come into play. At that point the landlord must pay the required relocation assistance within 7 days of receiving notice of the condemnation, eviction, or displacement order. If a landlord does not pay within that period, the governing agency may advance payment to the tenants and seek to recover from the landlord, with interest. The governing agency is entitled to its fees and costs and the landlord may face civil penalties if more than 60 days have passed.
</p>

<p>
¶ 30 Pham argues that “the legislative history” supports his interpretation and at oral argument cited RCW 59.18.085, Historical and Statutory Notes. But the notes, titled “Purpose” are consistent with our reading of the statute’s plain language. The notes read:
</p>

<p>
{{*833}} Certain tenants in the state of Washington have remained in rental housing that does not meet the state’s minimum standards for health and safety because they cannot afford to pay the costs of relocation in advance of occupying new, safe, and habitable housing. In egregious cases, authorities have been forced to condemn property when landlords have failed to remedy building code or health code violations after repeated notice, and, as a result, families with limited financial resources have been displaced and left with nowhere to go.
</p>

<p>
Subsection 3(a) addresses the first issue of tenants being forced to stay in substandard {{**223}} housing by requiring landlords to pay relocation assistance. Subsections (3)(c), (f), (g), and (h) were enacted for the “egregious cases,” where a landlord has notice and has refused to pay relocation assistance, and a governing authority is forced to condemn the property.
</p>

<p>
[25] <a id="orge9b8d27"></a> ¶ 31 Based on the language of the statute, we find that if RCW 59.18.085(3)(a) applies, a landlord is required to pay relocation assistance if the building will be condemned or deemed unlawful to occupy. In this circumstance, it is irrelevant whether the landlord has received notice of an order of condemnation, eviction, or displacement.
</p>

<p>
¶ 32 Pham next argues that he was never notified that the unit will “be condemned” or will “be unlawful to occupy.” Br. of Appellant at 17. The Tenants argue that Pham received three letters informing him that the units were illegal. The record shows that Pham received notice that the dwelling was unlawful to occupy because (1) it was permitted only for use as a triplex, and (2) its condition was substandard and violated multiple provisions of the housing code. The initial notice of violation states that Pham must:
</p>

<p>
DISCONTINUE THE MAINTENANCE/USE OF 9312 51st AVE. SOUTH AS A FIVEPLEX OR OBTAIN A PERMIT AND FINAL APPROVAL INSPECTION TO ESTABLISH THE USE. A FIVEPLEX IS NOT THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED USE OF THE PROPERTY; THE CURRENT PERMITTED USE OF THIS PROPERTY IS AS A TRIPLEX.
</p>

<p>
{{*834}} CP at 69. The second letter reads ,‘The units will have to be legalized, under a permit, or the tenants removed (you will have to pay them $2000 for tenant relocation assistance) and the units shut down and never rented again until they are legalized,” and ‘multiple repairs will be needed to the lower unit if it is to be permitted.” CP at 76. The final letter, dated June 6, 2013, indicated that there were numerous housing violations that would need to be addressed before the building would be legal to rent. Pham’s contention that the City did not notify him that the dwelling “is unlawful to occupy” is contradicted by the explicit text of the notice and letters. Br. of Appellant at 17.
</p>

<p>
¶ 33 Third, Pham argues that the statute and the Residential Landlord Tenant Act (RLTA) provide him with opportunity to cure before being required to pay relocation assistance. The Tenants argue that there is no cure period and to infer one would defeat the statute’s purpose, because landlords would take advantage of such period and delay taking any action until forced to do so.
</p>

<p>
[26] <a id="org7ab034b"></a> [27] <a id="orga6d82ca"></a> ¶ 34 We find that there is no safe harbor for landlords once they have been notified that the dwelling will be condemned or will be unlawful to occupy, even if they are in the process of permitting.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup> The statute inherently requires notice before the violation is issued because it applies only to landlords who “knew or should have known” about the conditions. RCW 59.18.085(3)(a). There is no additional opportunity to cure and to impose one would allow landlords to delay the process and continue to rent unlawful dwellings without penalty.
</p>


<p>
{{*835}} ¶ 35 Pham argues that the statute must contain an additional implicit notice requirement and cure period because RCW 59.18.085 notes indicate that a landlord is to receive “due notice.” LAWS OF 2005, ch. 364, § 1. The notes read ,‘The purpose of this act is to establish a process by which displaced tenants would receive funds for relocation from landlords who fail to provide safe and sanitary housing after due notice of building code or health code violations.” Id. Again, the legislature already provided for “due notice” by requiring a “governmental agency responsible for the enforcement of a building, housing, or other appropriate code” to “notif[y] the landlord that a dwelling” is or will be “condemned” or “unlawful to occupy,” before {{**224}} imposing a duty to provide relocation assistance. RCW 59.18.085(1), .085(3)(a).
</p>

<p>
[28] <a id="org1d87276"></a> ¶ 36 According to Pham, the City’s letter also gives him opportunity to cure. He claims he is not required to pay relocation assistance because the City gave him the option and he chose to permit the unit. The Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) imposes its own requirements for payment of relocation assistance upon the issuance of an emergency order to vacate. SMC 22.206.260(F). The City’s procedures do not affect the Tenants’ rights or a landlord’s obligations under the RLTA. Nothing in the SMC ‘is intended to affect or limit a tenant’s right to pursue a private right of action pursuant to Chapter 59.18 RCW for any violation of Chapter 59.18 RCW for which that chapter provides a private right of action.” SMC 22.206.305. Moreover, even if Pham had obtained the permits, the Unit was still unlawful to occupy because of the multiple violations of the housing code that had not been remedied.
</p>

<p>
¶ 37 Pham makes several additional perfunctory arguments against the Tenants’ entitlement to relocation costs. We reject each of them. Pham’s claim that substantial evidence did not support the trial court’s finding that the building was unlawful to occupy is meritless. The explicit language in the City’s letters demonstrate otherwise. Pham’s argument that the statute does not allow assistance {{*836}} to be paid to tenants who choose to relocate is simply incorrect. RCW 59.18.085(3) does not address a tenant’s choice to relocate, but subsection (2) specifically allows a tenant who “elects to terminate the tenancy as a result of the conditions leading to the posting” to recover additional damages if a landlord knowingly violates subsection (1). The trial court stated that the tenants “elected to be relocated” but found that Pham had to pay only relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085(3)(a). CP at 88. Thus, the trial court’s comment is of no consequence to the Tenants’ entitlement to relocation assistance. Even if the tenants had chosen to relocate, it would not negate the mandatory payment required by subsection (3)(a).
</p>

<p>
[29] <a id="org662c56e"></a> ¶ 38 Pham also argues that a tenant can sue under RCW 59.18.085(3)(e) only if relocation assistance has been ordered and the landlord fails to pay. The Tenants argue that subsection (3)(e) creates a private right of action against a landlord, independent of governmental enforcement. We agree with the Tenants and find that subsection (3)(e) allows a tenant to bring a private action to recover relocation assistance due under subsection (3)(a). The text of subsection (3)(e) distinguishes the governmental enforcement and the private right by allowing attorney fees and costs to be awarded for actions brought under subsections (3) (e) or (3)(c).
</p>

<p>
¶ 39 Finally, Pham argues that the trial court was required to find that he brought the eviction to avoid paying relocation assistance.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup> Reply Br. at 6. This is not correct. RCW 59.18.085(3)(a) requires payment of relocation assistance regardless of whether any retaliatory action has been taken against the tenants.
</p>


<p>
{{*837}} Tenants’ Default
</p>

<p>
[30] <a id="org62a376b"></a> ¶ 40 Pham argues that the trial court wrongfully applied the Tenants’ last month’s rent to bring them out of default. He claims that in order to apply the last month’s rent, the Tenants had to (1) give 20 days’ notice of intent to vacate, (2) indicate that they wanted to apply the last month’s rent to that final month, and (3) actually vacate. Br. of Appellant at 14. The Tenants claim that they are entitled to apply the prepaid last months’ rent as an offset for any amount due and owing.
</p>

<p>
¶ 41 We find no error in the trial court’s assessment. Pham received a month’s worth of prepaid rent from the Tenants. The lease does not contain any provisions specifying how this prepaid rent will be applied, or any conditions that must be met before it may be credited. Again, under RCW 59.18.400, a defendant in an unlawful detainer action “may assert any legal or equitable defense or {{**225}} set-off arising out of the tenancy.” The Tenants raised the defense that they were current in rent because they prepaid the last month’s rent. The trial court appropriately applied the prepayment as an offset and found that the Tenants prevailed on their defense that no rent is due and owing.
</p>

<p>
¶ 42 Pham argues that the Tenants were barred by RCW 59.18.080 from exercising remedies under the RLTA because they were not current in rent. The Tenants argue that they can exercise RLTA remedies because RCW 59.18.080 does not limit the right to raise a defense that there is no rent due and owing.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
¶ 43 RCW 59.18.080 requires a tenant to “be current in the payment of rent including all utilities &#x2026; before {{*838}} exercising any of the remedies accorded him or her under the provisions of this chapter &#x2026; PROVIDED FURTHER, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant’s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.” As discussed earlier, the Tenants raised the defenses that they did not owe any rent due to their claims of setoff and breach of warranty of habitability. The trial court found that they prevailed on those claims and that they were current in the payment of rent.
</p>

<p>
[31] <a id="orgf0736bc"></a> ¶ 44 Pham also argues that the tenants had not proved any diminution in value for the alleged defects in the premises. According to him, the trial court’s conclusion that the premises were 25 percent uninhabitable was not supported by evidence and, even if it were, the Tenants are still required to tender rent for the diminished value. We disagree. First, the Tenants have already paid full rent for the entire lease term, and rent for May 2013 was prepaid. The trial court also required the Tenants to tender rent for June and July 2013 and calculated that amount into the offset, even though the Unit had been deemed illegal to inhabit at that time.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup> Second, there is substantial evidence in the record to support a finding of significantly reduced habitability as a result of the sewer leak, the rodent problem, the structural defects, the electrical violations, and the “very poor” overall quality of the Unit’s installation. VRP at 114. At trial, the Tenants proposed a percentage of 25 based on an estimate of the percentage of actual uninhabitable space in the Unit. This included “the pantry area, any areas where there were rats &#x2026; [or] sewage smell.” VRP at 217. Pham accepted the estimate at that time but later disputed it in his motion for reconsideration. From the record, a rational, fair-minded person could easily find that the Unit’s habitability had been reduced by 25 percent.
</p>


<p>
[32] <a id="org40fdfcc"></a> ¶ 45 Pham argues that the trial court should have found that the terms of the lease agreement continued to apply after the lease expired. He claims he should have been allowed to charge late fees for the months that the Tenants held over and failed to pay rent. The Tenants claim that they were not subject to late fees because they were not late—they had already overpaid based on the unit’s condition.
</p>

<p>
[33] <a id="org7f426b7"></a> ¶ 46 The relevant portion of the trial court’s finding reads:
</p>

<p>
As Plaintiff acknowledges, late fees are a provision of the lease that expired April 30, 2013, and Defendants paid rent through that date. No evidence was offered to suggest the parties orally agreed that the lease terms continue into a month-to-month tenancy. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim for late fees has no legal basis. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that Defendants are excused from payment of rent after expiration of the lease&#x2026;. CP at 84–85.
</p>

<p>
{{**226}} The lease states ,‘If any rent is not paid on or before the due date, Tenant agrees to pay a late charge of [$]25 for each day that the same is delinquent, including the day of payment&#x2026;.” CP at 56. Pham correctly cites the general rule that the terms of a fixed lease apply to the terms of a holdover tenancy, even in the absence of language in a holdover provision. Marsh–McLennan Bldg., Inc. v. Clapp, 96 Wash.App. 636, 644–648, 980 P.2d 311 (1999). Under this rule, the terms of the lease would have extended to the holdover tenancy and Pham would have been entitled to charge late fees if the Tenants had been in default.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
[34] <a id="org195c70d"></a> ¶ 47 We find that the terms of the lease apply to the holdover tenancy. However, we agree with the trial court’s {{*840}} assessment that Pham’s claim for late fees “has no legal basis” because the Tenants were found to be current in rent. CP at 84. An appellate court may “sustain a trial court’s judgment upon any theory established by the pleadings and supported by proof.” Wendle v. Farrow, 102 Wash.2d 380, 382, 686 P.2d 480 (1984) (citing Gross v. Lynnwood, 90 Wash.2d 395, 401, 583 P.2d 1197 (1978)). Based on Pham’s breach of the warranty of habitability, the trial court concluded that as of April 2013, the Tenants had overpaid rent for nine months, and that overpayment had already covered the rent due for May, June, and July 2013. Therefore, at the time of trial, there was no rent that had “not [been] paid on or before the due date.” CP at 56.
</p>

<p>
¶ 48 The Tenants request an award of attorney’s fees as the prevailing party on appeal. Under RCW 59.18.290 and RAP 18.1, the Tenants are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs on appeal.

Even if Pham were correct that a relocation assistance claim did not relate to possession, there is no reason why the trial court could not have resolved the question of possession and then converted the unlawful detainer action to a civil action at that time. This would have permitted the trial court to address the relocation assistance claim in the same proceeding, while preserving the special nature of the unlawful detainer action. Where the right to possession ceases to be at issue at any time between the commencement of an unlawful detainer action and trial of that action, the proceeding may be converted into an ordinary civil suit for damages. Munden, 105 Wash.2d at 45–46, 711 P.2d 295. Despite Pham’s contention at oral argument that this is “not the law,” a trial court has “inherent power to fashion the method by which an unlawful detainer action is converted to an ordinary civil action.” Id. at 47, 711 P.2d 295. Once the case has been converted, the trial court’s general jurisdiction is restored and it can hear claims between the parties that were excluded from the unlawful detainer action.

Pham also argues that the trial court erred in finding that he breached the duty imposed by the implied warranty of habitability, because the duty requires nothing more than for a landlord to act with “reasonable diligence to eliminate dangers that pose an actual or potential safety hazard to its occupants.” Br. of Appellant at 12. He contends “ ‘[t]here is no breach if the landlord’s efforts are reasonable but unsuccessful.’ ” Id. But the case Pham cites, Lian v. Stalick, 106 Wash.App. 811, 818, 25 P.3d 467 (2001), supports neither proposition. Nowhere in Lian does the court suggest that a finding of breach is precluded if a landlord merely takes reasonable measures to cure.

At oral argument, Pham claimed that without additional notice and opportunity to cure, the statute as written would open the floodgates for relocation assistance claims because tenants would be able to sit idly in substandard conditions and only notify their landlords when they were facing eviction.

The trial court in its discretion awarded Pham rent for that period because the Tenants were still in possession.

<p>
Background: Landlord brought unlawful detainer action against tenants. Tenants counterclaimed for relocation assistance and raised defenses of setoff and breach of implied warranty of habitability. Following a bench trial, the Superior Court, King County, Judith H. Ramseyer, J., found that landlord had breached implied warranty and awarded damages and relocation assistance to tenants. Landlord appealed.
</p>

<p>
Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Spearman, C.J., held that:
</p>

<p>
[1] evidence was sufficient to establish that landlord breached implied warranty of habitability;
</p>

<p>
[2] tenants provided landlord with notice and opportunity to cure defects in rental unit;
</p>

<p>
[3] tenants were entitled to relocation assistance;
</p>

<p>
[4] tenants were entitled to offset pre-paid rent against unpaid rent;
</p>

<p>
[5] evidence supported finding that rental unit’s habitability had been reduced by 25%;
</p>

<p>
[6] landlord was not entitled to charge tenants late fees for holdover tenancy.
</p>

<p>
Affirmed.
</p>

<p>
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal.

<p>
Tenants were entitled to raise counterclaim for relocation assistance in landlord’s unlawful detainer action; issue of right to possession was intimately tied to lawful status of the unit and tenants’ right to relocation assistance, relocation assistance claim was based on facts that would excuse tenants’ breach because it required finding that the dwelling was or would be unlawful to occupy, and excluding relocation assistance claim from unlawful detainer proceedings would undermine the goals of the relocation assistance statute.

For a breach of implied warranty of habitability, the trier of fact must find: (1) whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant’s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord’s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability.

SPEARMAN, C.J.
</p>

<p>
{{*821}} ¶ 1 Landlord Lang Pham brought this unlawful detainer action against tenants Shakia Morgan and Shawn Corbett (Tenants). The Tenants counterclaimed for relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085 and raised defenses of setoff and breach of implied warranty of habitability. The trial court found that Pham had breached the implied warranty and awarded damages and relocation assistance to the Tenants. Pham appeals, disputing the trial court’s findings of fact, the Tenants’ entitlement to damages, and their right to bring counterclaims in an unlawful detainer action. Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the trial court.
</p>

<p>
{{*822}} FACTS
</p>

<p>
¶ 2 Lang Pham purchased the residential property located at 9312 51st Avenue South, Seattle, Washington (Property) at a foreclosure sale in March 2012. Pham owns and rents other apartment buildings. The Property was metered for five living units, so Pham had assumed it met regulatory requirements for use as a fiveplex. But the Property was permitted only for use as a triplex. Renting the building as a fiveplex violated city land use and building codes. Pham repainted, installed new carpet, and refinished the floors, but did not verify the building’s permit status before renting the five units. The permit information could easily have been accessed through the King County assessor and the website of the city of Seattle, Department of Planning and Development (City).
</p>

<p>
¶ 3 On April 25, 2012, Pham and Shawn Corbett and Shakia Morgan entered into a one-year lease agreement for unit 5 (Unit) of the Property, for May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013. The Tenants were required to pay $850 rent on the first of each month. They paid the first and last month’s rent and a security deposit of $650, for a total of $2,350.
</p>

<p>
¶ 4 The tenancy presented a number of difficulties. The Tenants’ income varied and they often paid their rent late or in installments. They complained to Pham about the Unit’s conditions, including the absence of baseboards, holes and gaps between the floor, walls, and doors, lack of railings on an outside deck and stairs, leaking water/sewage in a large “crawl space,” and the stench of sewage coming from the bathroom sink. Pham characterized the Tenants’ complaints as “playing this game” and arising only when rent was due. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) at 64–65; 68. In contrast, the Tenants said that Pham would tell them to address the issues themselves, or would fail to address their concerns at all.
</p>

<p>
¶ 5 In August 2012, the Tenants notified Pham that they had seen a rat in the Unit. Pham hired an exterminator to {{*823}} inspect and treat the Property for rodents and insects on a quarterly basis. The exterminator came twice to spray and set traps. Because the exterminator did not see evidence of rats, {{**218}} Pham discontinued the scheduled quarterly visits and opted for annual visits. The Tenants continued to see and hear rats in the Unit, and caught several rats using traps they purchased and placed themselves.
</p>

<p>
¶ 6 The Tenants had paid rent in full through April 2013, when the lease expired. The lease provided that the Tenants would be liable for rent and other damages sustained as a result of any holdover. The Tenants did not make any subsequent rent payments and were still in possession of the Unit at the time of trial in July 2013. Because the Tenants did not make payment or payment arrangements for May 2013, Pham testified that he posted and mailed a three-day pay or vacate notice on May 6, 2013, but the Tenants denied receiving it.
</p>

<p>
¶ 7 On May 10, 2013, the Tenants filed a complaint with the City regarding the Unit’s conditions. Five days later, city housing and zoning inspector Tom Bradrick, inspected the Unit. Bradrick found that “the overall quality of the installation of the unit was very poor and would never have passed a building inspection at that time&#x2026;.” VRP at 114.
</p>

<p>
¶ 8 On May 16, 2013, the day after the inspection, Pham served the Tenants with another three-day pay or vacate notice. The next day Bradrick mailed a notice of violation to Pham’s home address notifying him that the Property was not permitted for use as a fiveplex and that he needed to take corrective action by June 30, 2013.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Pham testified that he did not receive this letter until May 22, 2013, five days later.
</p>


<p>
{{*824}} ¶ 9 On Monday, May 20, 2013, Pham filed an unlawful detainer action to evict the Tenants because they failed to comply with the May 16, 2013 pay or vacate notice.
</p>

<p>
¶ 10 Bradrick sent a follow up letter on Wednesday, May 22, 2013, notifying Pham that the Property must be brought into compliance or the City would require him to pay relocation assistance of $2,000.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> The letter also advised Pham that multiple repairs would be required before permitting the Unit, and that the sewage leak would need to be repaired immediately.
</p>


<p>
¶ 11 On June 6, 2013, Bradrick sent Pham a third letter listing specific repairs that needed to be done in order to obtain a permit and pass a housing inspection. These repairs included the sewage leak, the absence of a P-trap in the vanity drain under the bathroom sink, and the rodent access to the crawl space and bedroom closet. The letter again instructed Pham that if he did not make the necessary repairs, he would need to discontinue renting the Unit and pay $2,000 in relocation assistance. Pham hired an architect to work on permitting the Property for use as a fiveplex. At the time of trial, because Pham was still waiting to find out whether such use would be permittable, none of the other repairs had been made.
</p>

<p>
¶ 12 A bench trial was held on July 17, 2013. The parties presented testimony from five witnesses: Pham, Eric Bittenbender from Paratex Pest Control, Bradrick, Morgan, and Corbett. The trial court found that the Unit’s habitability had been reduced by 25 percent for the nine-month period in which the Tenants lived with the sewer and rodent issues. The trial court determined that the Tenants had {{*825}} overpaid rent for that period, but also that they owed rent because they remained in the Unit for two additional months without paying. The Tenants were awarded a net amount of $637.50 for the habitability claim, $2,550.00 in relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085 and $650.00 for {{**219}} their security deposit. The trial court denied Pham’s motion for reconsideration and awarded attorney’s fees to the Tenants. Pham appeals.

Substantial evidence exists when there is a sufficient quantity of evidence to persuade a fair-minded, rational person that a finding is true.” Hegwine v.

Counterclaims in an Unlawful Detainer Action
</p>

<p>
¶ 14 Pham argues that the Tenants cannot bring counterclaims for relocation assistance and for damages for breach of implied warranty of habitability in an unlawful {{*826}} detainer proceeding.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> The Tenants argue that these claims are equitable defenses that directly relate to the issue of possession and, if proved, would excuse a breach of lease.
</p>


<p>
[6] <a id="org5e81a3f"></a> [7] <a id="org3bb7eda"></a> ¶ 15 Pham correctly cites the rule that counterclaims are not allowed in unlawful detainer actions, except for those “ ‘based on facts that would excuse a tenant’s breach.’ ” Br. of Appellant at 19, (quoting Josephinium Assoc. v. Kahli, 111 Wash.App. 617, 625, 45 P.3d 627 (2002).) The exception properly applies when resolution of the counterclaim is “necessary to determine the right of possession.” First Union Mgmt., Inc. v. Slack, 36 Wash.App. 849, 854, 679 P.2d 936 (1984).
</p>

<p>
¶ 16 Under this exception, Washington courts have permitted counterclaims for breach of warranty of habitability and breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wash.2d 22, 32, 515 P.2d 160 (1973); Income Props. Inv. Corp. v. Trefethen, 155 Wash. 493, 284 P. 782 (1930). The Foisy court approved of the affirmative defense of breach of warranty of habitability, because it “goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action&#x2026;.” 83 Wash.2d at 31–32, 515 P.2d 160. Pham claims that the Foisy standard is “limited to the diminution in rental value” only, not claims for damages, but cites no authority for this argument. Br. of Appellant at 21. On the contrary, Foisy is often cited as the authority allowing counterclaims for damages for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. See Munden v. Hazelrigg, 105 Wash.2d 39, 41, 711 P.2d 295 (1985), Angelo Prop. Co., LP v. Hafiz, 167 Wash.App. 789, 811–812, 274 P.3d 1075 (2012); Heaverlo v. Keico Indus., Inc., 80 Wash.App. 724, 729, 911 P.2d 406 (1996). Furthermore, RCW 59.18.400 enables a tenant to “assert any legal or equitable defense or set-off arising out of the tenancy.” We reject Pham’s arguments and {{*827}} hold that the Tenants are permitted to raise the defense of breach of warranty of habitability in this action.

An unlawful detainer action is a limited statutory proceeding to resolve the right to possession between the landlord and the tenant. Chapter 59.12 RCW; Munden, 105 Wash.2d at 45, 711 P.2d 295. The law draws a distinction between possession and the right of possession. {{**220}} Kessler v. Nielsen, 3 Wash.App. 120, 126, 472 P.2d 616 (1970). Once an unlawful detainer action is commenced and the defendant does not concede the right to possession, he or she has the right to have the issue determined. Housing Auth. of City of Pasco and Franklin Cty. v. Pleasant, 126 Wash.App. 382, 389, 109 P.3d 422 (2005).
</p>

<p>
[12] <a id="org1e0a3e1"></a> [13] <a id="org113f14f"></a> [14] <a id="org4f08496"></a> ¶ 18 Pham argues that the trial court “fail[ed] to explain how relocation assistance relates to possession of the property.” Br. of Appellant at 21. And he claims it is contradictory for a tenant to ask for assistance to vacate while he or she continues to assert a right to possession. We disagree. By seeking relocation assistance, the Tenants do not concede the right to possession. Instead, they claim the right has been compromised by the Unit’s unlawful status, which, in turn, gives rise to the claim for relocation assistance. Thus, the issue of the right to possession is intimately tied to the lawful status of the Unit and the Tenants’ right to relocation assistance. Furthermore, the relocation assistance claim is also based on facts that would excuse a tenant’s breach, because it requires a finding that the dwelling is or will be unlawful to occupy. A landlord would be precluded from renting a dwelling that was illegal to occupy, and any tenants would be absolved of their duty to pay rent.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
[15] <a id="org98c4ed3"></a> {{*828}} ¶ 19 The Tenants also argue that excluding relocation assistance claims from unlawful detainer proceedings would undermine the goals of the statute. We find this argument persuasive. The legislature’s stated purpose when it enacted RCW 59.18.085 was to prevent tenants from being forced to “remain[ ] in rental housing that does not meet the state’s minimum standards for health and safety because they cannot afford to pay the costs of relocation in advance of occupying new, safe, and habitable housing.” See RCW 59.18.085, LAWS OF 2005 ch. 364, § 1. Requiring displaced tenants to bring separate actions for relocation assistance on the regular civil calendar would impose unnecessary delay and costs on top of the financial burdens involved in the moving process. In accordance with the statute’s purpose, we hold that an unlawful detainer action is an appropriate forum for relocation assistance claims under RCW 59.18.085.
</p>

<p>
Implied Warranty of Habitability
</p>

<p>
[16] <a id="orgdee050a"></a> ¶ 20 Pham claims that the trial court’s finding of breach of the implied warranty of habitability is not supported by substantial evidence. He argues that the sewer leak did not present a habitability issue or, if it did, he was not notified or given opportunity to cure. He also argues that there was no evidence of a rodent infestation. The Tenants argue that the record contains sufficient evidence to show that Pham breached the implied warrant of habitability.
</p>

<p>
[17] <a id="org74f0405"></a> [18] <a id="orgaace92d"></a> [19] <a id="org29c4ec6"></a> [20] <a id="org158b16f"></a> ¶ 21 In a residential unlawful detainer action, a tenant may raise a defense based on a landlord’s breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Foisy, 83 Wash.2d at 32, 515 P.2d 160. {{*829}} For a breach of this warranty, the trier of fact must find “(1) Whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant’s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord’s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability.” Id. at 34, 515 P.2d 160. A warranty’s applicability is a mixed question of law and fact.  {{**221}} Burbo v. Harley C. Douglass, Inc., 125 Wash.App. 684, 694, 106 P.3d 258 (2005). Conditions that “present a substantial risk of future danger” will give rise to a claim for breach of warranty of habitability. Westlake View Condo. Ass’n. v. Sixth Ave. View Partners, LLC., 146 Wash.App. 760, 771, 193 P.3d 161 (2008).
</p>

<p>
[21] <a id="org575a354"></a> ¶ 22 The record contains ample evidence of conditions in the Unit that would cause a fair-minded, rational person to find a substantial risk of future danger. As long as substantial evidence supports the trial court’s findings, “a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court even though it might have resolved a factual dispute differently.” Sunnyside, 149 Wash.2d at 879–80, 73 P.3d 369. Pham misstates the evidence when he claims that Bradrick testified that “the habitability issues were not so egregious as to warrant an order of condemnation, eviction or displacement, even though he had authority to issue such orders.” Reply Brief at 11. Bradrick testified that he did not consider the sewer leak to be “egregious to the point where I was going to get excited and create an emergency on it or anything, but I did want it to be addressed relatively quickly.” VRP at 115. He further testified that “[i]f I went back to inspect today, and the sewage had not been rectified, I would immediately put out an emergency order, yes.” VRP at 132. The Tenants also testified about the sewage leak and smell and presented evidence that Pham had been informed that the lines needed to be replaced. The Tenants’ testimony about the persistence of rodents as well as Bradrick’s testimony and letter, all supported a likelihood that rodents were present. Bradrick also testified about the {{*830}} poor condition and installation of the stairs and handrails, back door, sewer pipe, door to the crawl space, and bathroom sink, and dangerous electrical violations. We find that the record contains sufficient evidence to support a finding of breach of the warranty of habitability.
</p>

<p>
[22] <a id="org33f1391"></a> ¶ 23 Pham argues the Tenants failed to provide him with notice and opportunity to cure any defects as required by RCW 59.18.070. Br. of Appellant at 11. The argument is without merit. The record shows that Pham had ample notice of the defects and an opportunity to cure them. In addition to the complaints from the Tenants, Pham received at least three letters from Bradrick advising him of the defects. Pham presented no evidence that to the extent he acted in response to these complaints, the defects were ever cured.
</p>

<p>
[23] <a id="org4900dbc"></a> ¶ 24 Pham argues that the trial court applied the wrong standard when it found him in breach of the implied warranty of habitability. He contends the trial court erroneously required him to take “ ‘all reasonable measures’ ” to ensure that the unit was rodent-free because the Tenants had a small child. Br. of Appellant at 12–13. In support of this argument Pham points to the court’s oral ruling, in which, quoting Landis, it stated “ ‘[t]here is no doubt that a rodent infestation can create an actual or potential safety hazard’ ” and that this was “ ‘especially true where, as here, an infant is in the home.’ ” CP at 85. The trial court also stated that Pham “had a responsibility to take all reasonable measures to keep rats from the unit, which he failed to do.” Id. But the trial court’s written findings show that its conclusion was based on the totality of the circumstances, including the sewage leak, the rats, the odors, the faulty handrails, the holes in the floor, and Pham’s failure to remedy any of the conditions.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> A written {{*831}} order controls over any apparent inconsistency with the court’s earlier oral ruling. Shellenbarger v. Brigman, 101 Wash.App. 339, 346, 3 P.3d 211 (2000). Accordingly, we reject Pham’s argument that the trial court relied on an improper standard of habitability when it {{**222}} concluded that he breached the implied warranty of habitability.
</p>


<p>
Award of Relocation Assistance
</p>

<p>
[24] <a id="org0932d6a"></a> ¶ 25 Pham argues that the trial court erred in finding that the Tenants were entitled to relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085(3). Pham’s first argument is one of statutory interpretation. He argues that the Tenants are not entitled to relocation assistance because the City never issued a “notice of condemnation, eviction or displacement order.” Br. of Appellant at 17. The Tenants argue that an order is not required because the obligation to provide relocation assistance arose when Pham was notified that the dwelling was unlawful.
</p>

<p>
¶ 26 This court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo. State v. Wentz, 149 Wash.2d 342, 346, 68 P.3d 282 (2003). In interpreting statutes, we strive to discern and implement the Legislature’s intent. State v. J.P., 149 Wash.2d 444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003). Where the plain language of a statute is unambiguous, and “the legislative intent is apparent &#x2026; we will not construe the statute otherwise.” Id. (citing State v. Wilson, 125 Wash.2d 212, 217, 883 P.2d 320 (1994)). Plain meaning, however, may be gleaned “from all that the Legislature has said in the statute and related statutes which disclose legislative intent about the provision in question.” Dep’t of Ecology v. Campbell &amp; Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wash.2d 1, 11, 43 P.3d 4 (2002).
</p>

<p>
¶ 27 Pham bases his argument on RCW 59.18.085(3)(c)’s reference to a “notice of the condemnation, {{*832}} eviction, or displacement order.”<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> Amicus King County Bar Association (KCBA) argues that the obligation to pay relocation assistance under subsection (3)(a) does not require that a unit actually be condemned or unlawful to occupy. It is enough for an agency to notify a landlord that the dwelling will be condemned or will be unlawful to occupy.
</p>


<p>
¶ 28 We agree with the Tenants and KCBA. The plain language of RCW 59.18.085(3) supports this interpretation. Subsection 3(a) applies when a landlord has been notified that the dwelling will be condemned or unlawful to occupy due to conditions that violate applicable codes, statutes, ordinances, or regulations. At that point, a landlord who knew or should have known of the conditions shall be required to pay relocation assistance, unless the conditions are a result of illegal activity, natural disaster, or acquisition by eminent domain. RCW 59.18.085(3)(i)-(iii).
</p>

<p>
¶ 29 If a landlord refuses to pay relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085(3)(a) and the governing agency is forced to condemn the dwelling, then the enforcement mechanisms in subsections (3)(c), (f), (g), and (h) come into play. At that point the landlord must pay the required relocation assistance within 7 days of receiving notice of the condemnation, eviction, or displacement order. If a landlord does not pay within that period, the governing agency may advance payment to the tenants and seek to recover from the landlord, with interest. The governing agency is entitled to its fees and costs and the landlord may face civil penalties if more than 60 days have passed.
</p>

<p>
¶ 30 Pham argues that “the legislative history” supports his interpretation and at oral argument cited RCW 59.18.085, Historical and Statutory Notes. But the notes, titled “Purpose” are consistent with our reading of the statute’s plain language. The notes read:
</p>

<p>
{{*833}} Certain tenants in the state of Washington have remained in rental housing that does not meet the state’s minimum standards for health and safety because they cannot afford to pay the costs of relocation in advance of occupying new, safe, and habitable housing. In egregious cases, authorities have been forced to condemn property when landlords have failed to remedy building code or health code violations after repeated notice, and, as a result, families with limited financial resources have been displaced and left with nowhere to go.
</p>

<p>
Subsection 3(a) addresses the first issue of tenants being forced to stay in substandard {{**223}} housing by requiring landlords to pay relocation assistance. Subsections (3)(c), (f), (g), and (h) were enacted for the “egregious cases,” where a landlord has notice and has refused to pay relocation assistance, and a governing authority is forced to condemn the property.
</p>

<p>
[25] <a id="orga8f3e6d"></a> ¶ 31 Based on the language of the statute, we find that if RCW 59.18.085(3)(a) applies, a landlord is required to pay relocation assistance if the building will be condemned or deemed unlawful to occupy. In this circumstance, it is irrelevant whether the landlord has received notice of an order of condemnation, eviction, or displacement.
</p>

<p>
¶ 32 Pham next argues that he was never notified that the unit will “be condemned” or will “be unlawful to occupy.” Br. of Appellant at 17. The Tenants argue that Pham received three letters informing him that the units were illegal. The record shows that Pham received notice that the dwelling was unlawful to occupy because (1) it was permitted only for use as a triplex, and (2) its condition was substandard and violated multiple provisions of the housing code. The initial notice of violation states that Pham must:
</p>

<p>
DISCONTINUE THE MAINTENANCE/USE OF 9312 51st AVE. SOUTH AS A FIVEPLEX OR OBTAIN A PERMIT AND FINAL APPROVAL INSPECTION TO ESTABLISH THE USE. A FIVEPLEX IS NOT THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED USE OF THE PROPERTY; THE CURRENT PERMITTED USE OF THIS PROPERTY IS AS A TRIPLEX.
</p>

<p>
{{*834}} CP at 69. The second letter reads ,‘The units will have to be legalized, under a permit, or the tenants removed (you will have to pay them $2000 for tenant relocation assistance) and the units shut down and never rented again until they are legalized,” and ‘multiple repairs will be needed to the lower unit if it is to be permitted.” CP at 76. The final letter, dated June 6, 2013, indicated that there were numerous housing violations that would need to be addressed before the building would be legal to rent. Pham’s contention that the City did not notify him that the dwelling “is unlawful to occupy” is contradicted by the explicit text of the notice and letters. Br. of Appellant at 17.
</p>

<p>
¶ 33 Third, Pham argues that the statute and the Residential Landlord Tenant Act (RLTA) provide him with opportunity to cure before being required to pay relocation assistance. The Tenants argue that there is no cure period and to infer one would defeat the statute’s purpose, because landlords would take advantage of such period and delay taking any action until forced to do so.
</p>

<p>
[26] <a id="org45e08b1"></a> [27] <a id="orge8b10d4"></a> ¶ 34 We find that there is no safe harbor for landlords once they have been notified that the dwelling will be condemned or will be unlawful to occupy, even if they are in the process of permitting.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup> The statute inherently requires notice before the violation is issued because it applies only to landlords who “knew or should have known” about the conditions. RCW 59.18.085(3)(a). There is no additional opportunity to cure and to impose one would allow landlords to delay the process and continue to rent unlawful dwellings without penalty.
</p>


<p>
{{*835}} ¶ 35 Pham argues that the statute must contain an additional implicit notice requirement and cure period because RCW 59.18.085 notes indicate that a landlord is to receive “due notice.” LAWS OF 2005, ch. 364, § 1. The notes read ,‘The purpose of this act is to establish a process by which displaced tenants would receive funds for relocation from landlords who fail to provide safe and sanitary housing after due notice of building code or health code violations.” Id. Again, the legislature already provided for “due notice” by requiring a “governmental agency responsible for the enforcement of a building, housing, or other appropriate code” to “notif[y] the landlord that a dwelling” is or will be “condemned” or “unlawful to occupy,” before {{**224}} imposing a duty to provide relocation assistance. RCW 59.18.085(1), .085(3)(a).
</p>

<p>
[28] <a id="org75ce576"></a> ¶ 36 According to Pham, the City’s letter also gives him opportunity to cure. He claims he is not required to pay relocation assistance because the City gave him the option and he chose to permit the unit. The Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) imposes its own requirements for payment of relocation assistance upon the issuance of an emergency order to vacate. SMC 22.206.260(F). The City’s procedures do not affect the Tenants’ rights or a landlord’s obligations under the RLTA. Nothing in the SMC ‘is intended to affect or limit a tenant’s right to pursue a private right of action pursuant to Chapter 59.18 RCW for any violation of Chapter 59.18 RCW for which that chapter provides a private right of action.” SMC 22.206.305. Moreover, even if Pham had obtained the permits, the Unit was still unlawful to occupy because of the multiple violations of the housing code that had not been remedied.
</p>

<p>
¶ 37 Pham makes several additional perfunctory arguments against the Tenants’ entitlement to relocation costs. We reject each of them. Pham’s claim that substantial evidence did not support the trial court’s finding that the building was unlawful to occupy is meritless. The explicit language in the City’s letters demonstrate otherwise. Pham’s argument that the statute does not allow assistance {{*836}} to be paid to tenants who choose to relocate is simply incorrect. RCW 59.18.085(3) does not address a tenant’s choice to relocate, but subsection (2) specifically allows a tenant who “elects to terminate the tenancy as a result of the conditions leading to the posting” to recover additional damages if a landlord knowingly violates subsection (1). The trial court stated that the tenants “elected to be relocated” but found that Pham had to pay only relocation assistance under RCW 59.18.085(3)(a). CP at 88. Thus, the trial court’s comment is of no consequence to the Tenants’ entitlement to relocation assistance. Even if the tenants had chosen to relocate, it would not negate the mandatory payment required by subsection (3)(a).
</p>

<p>
[29] <a id="org1281236"></a> ¶ 38 Pham also argues that a tenant can sue under RCW 59.18.085(3)(e) only if relocation assistance has been ordered and the landlord fails to pay. The Tenants argue that subsection (3)(e) creates a private right of action against a landlord, independent of governmental enforcement. We agree with the Tenants and find that subsection (3)(e) allows a tenant to bring a private action to recover relocation assistance due under subsection (3)(a). The text of subsection (3)(e) distinguishes the governmental enforcement and the private right by allowing attorney fees and costs to be awarded for actions brought under subsections (3) (e) or (3)(c).
</p>

<p>
¶ 39 Finally, Pham argues that the trial court was required to find that he brought the eviction to avoid paying relocation assistance.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup> Reply Br. at 6. This is not correct. RCW 59.18.085(3)(a) requires payment of relocation assistance regardless of whether any retaliatory action has been taken against the tenants.
</p>


<p>
{{*837}} Tenants’ Default
</p>

<p>
[30] <a id="orgbbaf6ef"></a> ¶ 40 Pham argues that the trial court wrongfully applied the Tenants’ last month’s rent to bring them out of default. He claims that in order to apply the last month’s rent, the Tenants had to (1) give 20 days’ notice of intent to vacate, (2) indicate that they wanted to apply the last month’s rent to that final month, and (3) actually vacate. Br. of Appellant at 14. The Tenants claim that they are entitled to apply the prepaid last months’ rent as an offset for any amount due and owing.
</p>

<p>
¶ 41 We find no error in the trial court’s assessment. Pham received a month’s worth of prepaid rent from the Tenants. The lease does not contain any provisions specifying how this prepaid rent will be applied, or any conditions that must be met before it may be credited. Again, under RCW 59.18.400, a defendant in an unlawful detainer action “may assert any legal or equitable defense or {{**225}} set-off arising out of the tenancy.” The Tenants raised the defense that they were current in rent because they prepaid the last month’s rent. The trial court appropriately applied the prepayment as an offset and found that the Tenants prevailed on their defense that no rent is due and owing.
</p>

<p>
¶ 42 Pham argues that the Tenants were barred by RCW 59.18.080 from exercising remedies under the RLTA because they were not current in rent. The Tenants argue that they can exercise RLTA remedies because RCW 59.18.080 does not limit the right to raise a defense that there is no rent due and owing.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
¶ 43 RCW 59.18.080 requires a tenant to “be current in the payment of rent including all utilities &#x2026; before {{*838}} exercising any of the remedies accorded him or her under the provisions of this chapter &#x2026; PROVIDED FURTHER, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant’s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.” As discussed earlier, the Tenants raised the defenses that they did not owe any rent due to their claims of setoff and breach of warranty of habitability. The trial court found that they prevailed on those claims and that they were current in the payment of rent.
</p>

<p>
[31] <a id="orgb373850"></a> ¶ 44 Pham also argues that the tenants had not proved any diminution in value for the alleged defects in the premises. According to him, the trial court’s conclusion that the premises were 25 percent uninhabitable was not supported by evidence and, even if it were, the Tenants are still required to tender rent for the diminished value. We disagree. First, the Tenants have already paid full rent for the entire lease term, and rent for May 2013 was prepaid. The trial court also required the Tenants to tender rent for June and July 2013 and calculated that amount into the offset, even though the Unit had been deemed illegal to inhabit at that time.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup> Second, there is substantial evidence in the record to support a finding of significantly reduced habitability as a result of the sewer leak, the rodent problem, the structural defects, the electrical violations, and the “very poor” overall quality of the Unit’s installation. VRP at 114. At trial, the Tenants proposed a percentage of 25 based on an estimate of the percentage of actual uninhabitable space in the Unit. This included “the pantry area, any areas where there were rats &#x2026; [or] sewage smell.” VRP at 217. Pham accepted the estimate at that time but later disputed it in his motion for reconsideration. From the record, a rational, fair-minded person could easily find that the Unit’s habitability had been reduced by 25 percent.
</p>


<p>
[32] <a id="orgf04f6cd"></a> ¶ 45 Pham argues that the trial court should have found that the terms of the lease agreement continued to apply after the lease expired. He claims he should have been allowed to charge late fees for the months that the Tenants held over and failed to pay rent. The Tenants claim that they were not subject to late fees because they were not late—they had already overpaid based on the unit’s condition.
</p>

<p>
[33] <a id="orga61fcc0"></a> ¶ 46 The relevant portion of the trial court’s finding reads:
</p>

<p>
As Plaintiff acknowledges, late fees are a provision of the lease that expired April 30, 2013, and Defendants paid rent through that date. No evidence was offered to suggest the parties orally agreed that the lease terms continue into a month-to-month tenancy. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim for late fees has no legal basis. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that Defendants are excused from payment of rent after expiration of the lease&#x2026;. CP at 84–85.
</p>

<p>
{{**226}} The lease states ,‘If any rent is not paid on or before the due date, Tenant agrees to pay a late charge of [$]25 for each day that the same is delinquent, including the day of payment&#x2026;.” CP at 56. Pham correctly cites the general rule that the terms of a fixed lease apply to the terms of a holdover tenancy, even in the absence of language in a holdover provision. Marsh–McLennan Bldg., Inc. v. Clapp, 96 Wash.App. 636, 644–648, 980 P.2d 311 (1999). Under this rule, the terms of the lease would have extended to the holdover tenancy and Pham would have been entitled to charge late fees if the Tenants had been in default.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
[34] <a id="org0239e50"></a> ¶ 47 We find that the terms of the lease apply to the holdover tenancy. However, we agree with the trial court’s {{*840}} assessment that Pham’s claim for late fees “has no legal basis” because the Tenants were found to be current in rent. CP at 84. An appellate court may “sustain a trial court’s judgment upon any theory established by the pleadings and supported by proof.” Wendle v. Farrow, 102 Wash.2d 380, 382, 686 P.2d 480 (1984) (citing Gross v. Lynnwood, 90 Wash.2d 395, 401, 583 P.2d 1197 (1978)). Based on Pham’s breach of the warranty of habitability, the trial court concluded that as of April 2013, the Tenants had overpaid rent for nine months, and that overpayment had already covered the rent due for May, June, and July 2013. Therefore, at the time of trial, there was no rent that had “not [been] paid on or before the due date.” CP at 56.
</p>

<p>
¶ 48 The Tenants request an award of attorney’s fees as the prevailing party on appeal. Under RCW 59.18.290 and RAP 18.1, the Tenants are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs on appeal.
</p>

<p>
¶ 49 Affirmed.

Under the Seattle Municipal Code, the City has the authority to issue a notice of violation that identifies each violation of the standards and requirements of the Code and the corrective action necessary to bring the building into compliance. SMC 22.206.220(A)(1). The Notice of Violation must also specify a time for compliance. SMC 22.206.220(A)(2).

Under SMC 22.206.260(A), whenever a building, housing unit, or premises has been found to be “an imminent threat to the health or safety of the occupants or the public, an emergency order may be issued directing that the building, housing unit or premises be restored to a condition of safety and specifying the time for compliance. In the alternative, the order may require that the building, housing unit or premises be immediately vacated and closed to entry.” Subsection (F)(1) requires relocation assistance to be paid to “[a]ny tenant who is required to vacate and actually vacates a housing unit as a result of an emergency order.”
</p></div></div>

Pham also argues that the Tenants are not entitled to a monetary award because they failed to pay the required filing fee for a counterclaim or obtain a waiver. But because he cites no authority for the argument, we decline to consider it.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.4" class="footnum" href="#fnr.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
Even if Pham were correct that a relocation assistance claim did not relate to possession, there is no reason why the trial court could not have resolved the question of possession and then converted the unlawful detainer action to a civil action at that time. This would have permitted the trial court to address the relocation assistance claim in the same proceeding, while preserving the special nature of the unlawful detainer action. Where the right to possession ceases to be at issue at any time between the commencement of an unlawful detainer action and trial of that action, the proceeding may be converted into an ordinary civil suit for damages. Munden, 105 Wash.2d at 45–46, 711 P.2d 295. Despite Pham’s contention at oral argument that this is “not the law,” a trial court has “inherent power to fashion the method by which an unlawful detainer action is converted to an ordinary civil action.” Id. at 47, 711 P.2d 295. Once the case has been converted, the trial court’s general jurisdiction is restored and it can hear claims between the parties that were excluded from the unlawful detainer action. Id. at 45–46, 711 P.2d 295.

Pham also argues that the trial court erred in finding that he breached the duty imposed by the implied warranty of habitability, because the duty requires nothing more than for a landlord to act with “reasonable diligence to eliminate dangers that pose an actual or potential safety hazard to its occupants.” Br. of Appellant at 12. He contends “ ‘[t]here is no breach if the landlord’s efforts are reasonable but unsuccessful.’ ” Id. But the case Pham cites, Lian v. Stalick, 106 Wash.App. 811, 818, 25 P.3d 467 (2001), supports neither proposition. Nowhere in Lian does the court suggest that a finding of breach is precluded if a landlord merely takes reasonable measures to cure.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.6" class="footnum" href="#fnr.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
RCW 59.18.085(3)(a)(i)-(ii) also refer to a “condemnation or no occupancy order.” These are the exceptions under which a landlord will not be required to pay relocation assistance, and neither apply here.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.7" class="footnum" href="#fnr.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
At oral argument, Pham claimed that without additional notice and opportunity to cure, the statute as written would open the floodgates for relocation assistance claims because tenants would be able to sit idly in substandard conditions and only notify their landlords when they were facing eviction. Again, the statute requires that a landlord be notified that a building is unlawful to occupy and to have actual or constructive knowledge of the conditions giving rise to the illegal status before requiring them to pay relocation assistance.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.8" class="footnum" href="#fnr.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
Subsection (3)(d) prevents a landlord from taking retaliatory or collateral action against tenants after receiving a notice of violation. This does not have any effect on a landlord’s duty to pay relocation assistance under subsection (3)(a).
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.9" class="footnum" href="#fnr.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
Alternatively, the Tenants argue that the statute does not limit the tenant’s “civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages” and that the standards required for relocation assistance should qualify as a civil remedy for negligent or intentional damages. Given our disposition of this case, we do not address this argument.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.10" class="footnum" href="#fnr.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
The trial court in its discretion awarded Pham rent for that period because the Tenants were still in possession. We note, however, that Pham’s entitlement to rent during that time is questionable given his knowledge that the Unit was unlawful to occupy. Nonetheless, because the Tenants did not appeal the issue, we will not disturb that award.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.11" class="footnum" href="#fnr.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
This assumes that the building would have been lawful to occupy. It was not lawful to occupy during the time that Pham argues that he is entitled to charge late fees.

<p>
Background: Property owner brought action against occupants of property, seeking to quiet title and to eject occupants. Occupants counterclaimed for unjust enrichment, based on improvements they made to property. After quieting title in property owner’s name, the Superior Court, Thurston County, Gary R. Tabor, J., awarded occupants the market value of the improvements, less certain general contractor’s costs that occupants did not incur in making the improvements. Occupants appealed. The Court of Appeals, 134 Wash.App. 1033, 2006 WL 2329471, reversed and remanded. Property petitioned for review.
</p>

<p>
[Holding:] The Supreme Court, sitting en banc, Sanders, J., held that occupants were entitled entire value of the benefit property owner received as determined by either the fair market value of the services rendered or the amount the improvements enhanced the value of the property, without a blanket deduction for general contractor’s costs.
</p>

<p>
Affirmed.
</p>

<p>
Owens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

<p>
Procedural Posture(s): On Appeal.

<p>
Three elements must be established in order to sustain a claim based on “unjust enrichment”: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) an appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and (3) the acceptance or retention by the defendant of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without the payment of its value.

<p>
A “contract implied in fact” is an agreement depending for its existence on some act or conduct of the party sought to be charged and arising by implication from circumstances which, according to common understanding, show a mutual intention on the part of the parties to contract with each other; the services must be rendered under such circumstances as to indicate that the person rendering them expected to be paid therefor, and that the recipient expected, or should have expected, to pay for them.

<p>
Property owner’s obligation to occupants of property who made improvements to property would be determined under an implied-in-law contract and the equitable theory of unjust enrichment, even though it was unclear whether there was a contract implied in fact or a contract implied in law between the parties, since occupants did not argue for an implied-in-fact contract.

Occupants of property who made improvements to the property were entitled, as the measure of their recovery from property owner for unjust enrichment, to the entire value of the benefit property owner received as determined by either the fair market value of the services rendered or the amount the improvements enhanced the value of the property, without a blanket deduction for costs that a general contractor would have incurred if general contractor had performed the work, absent a showing of fault on occupants’ part; property owner derived benefits from some general contractor’s costs, such as cost of providing tools and general equipment and the cost for debris disposal.

The measure of recovery for unjust enrichment to a faultless claimant for the claimant’s improvement to land is measured in one of two ways: it may be measured by the amount which the benefit conferred would have cost the defendant had it obtained the benefit from some other person in the plaintiff’s position, or alternatively, it may be measured by the extent to which the other party’s property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced.

In an unjust enrichment case, where the claimant is not at fault and the defendant agreed to improvements to land, fairness and justice dictate the defendant should be held to pay the entire amount as measured by how much it would have cost the defendant to purchase the improvements or by how much the improvement enhanced the value of the property.

SANDERS, J.
</p>

<p>
{{*480}} ¶ 1 Judith Young brought an action to quiet title against her nephew Jim Young and his wife, Shannon Young, over property located in Thurston County. Jim and Shannon<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> counterclaimed for unjust enrichment based on improvements they made to the property. At issue is the measure of recovery in their unjust enrichment claim.
</p>


<p>
¶ 2 The trial court awarded Jim and Shannon the market value of the improvements less certain costs the trial court determined did not apply. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding the trial court should have used the full market value as the measure of recovery. We affirm the Court of Appeals.
</p>

<p>
I. FACTS
</p>

<p>
¶ 3 The facts are undisputed. Judith runs an otter sanctuary in rural Georgia. Jim is a licensed and bonded contractor {{*481}} engaged in timber cutting, clearing, grading, dozing, and concrete slab construction. Jim and Shannon reside in Washington with their four children.
</p>

<p>
¶ 4 Judith expressed to Jim and Shannon her desire to move her otter sanctuary away from Georgia. In 1998 Jim became familiar with a piece of property for sale in Thurston County; the land and the buildings were in significant disrepair but Jim and Shannon thought it had characteristics suitable to Judith’s needs. Jim and Shannon told Judith about the property, including its run-down condition and potential for development. The three agreed Jim and Shannon would do all the work necessary to ready the property for Judith and her otters.
</p>

<p>
¶ 5 Judith purchased the Thurston County property in 1998 for $1,050,000. Judith included Jim’s name on the title in the good-faith belief this would allow Jim to obtain the necessary permits and approvals for the improvements. As a result of conversations with Judith, Jim reasonably believed Judith would pay him for his improvements to the property.
</p>

<p>
¶ 6 That year Jim and Shannon moved onto the property with Judith’s knowledge and lived there rent-free. Between the purchase of the property and the time of trial, Jim and Shannon did a large amount of work on the property. They extensively remodeled the house, demolished an older farmhouse, repaired a number of outbuildings, replaced the well equipment, cleared the property, and replaced the fencing, among other projects. All of the work was of workmanlike quality or better.
</p>

<p>
¶ 7 By the spring of 2001 Jim and Shannon began to suspect Judith would not move to the Thurston County property. They contacted her to discuss the possibility of turning the property into a working cattle ranch. By June 2001 all three believed in good faith they had formed an oral agreement to develop a cattle ranch. Jim and Shannon’s understanding {{**1261}} of the agreement differed significantly from Judith’s understanding, but they began to develop the cattle ranch in good faith according to their respective {{*482}} understandings of the agreement. By the fall of 2002 the relationship had soured and the parties had stopped communicating with each other.
</p>

<p>
¶ 8 In April 2003 Judith brought an action to quiet title in her name and to eject Jim and Shannon from the property, among other claims. Jim and Shannon counterclaimed for unjust enrichment based on the work they performed on the property, among other claims. The trial court quieted title in Judith’s name.
</p>

<p>
[1] <a id="orgb400b99"></a> ¶ 9 The court then determined it would be unjust for Judith to retain the value of the work on the Thurston County property without compensating Jim and Shannon for it. Expert testimony established the improvements would have cost Judith $760,382 if she had hired a third-party contractor to perform them. The court also found the value of the property increased by $1,150,000 to $1,450,000, but only $750,000 to $1,050,000 of the increased value was attributable to Jim and Shannon’s improvements. Neither party contests these findings.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
¶ 10 The court found the measure of recovery in an unjust enrichment claim is generally the greater of: (1) the cost to the owner of obtaining the same services from a third party, and (2) the amount the services have increased the value of the property. However, the court declined to apply this measure under the “particular circumstances of this case.” Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 639. Instead, it awarded Jim and Shannon the market value of the improvements, less the “general contractor’s costs” listed in the cost expert’s report. CP at 640. The total award was $501,866.
</p>

<p>
¶ 11 Jim and Shannon appealed. In an unpublished opinion Division Two of the Court of Appeals reversed, holding the trial court incorrectly measured recovery. It remanded for an award based on the full amount it would have cost Judith to pay a third-party to make the improvements. {{*483}} Young v. Young, noted at 134 Wash.App. 1033, 2006 WL 2329471, at {{*10}}–15. We granted Judith’s petition for review, 160 Wash.2d 1010, 161 P.3d 1027 (2007), and affirm the Court of Appeal.
</p>

<p>
II. ANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
A
</p>

<p>
[2] <a id="orgf427c95"></a> ¶ 12 Jim and Shannon argue the measure of recovery is either the market value of the services provided or the increase in value attributable to their work. Judith argues the circumstances of the claimant affect the measure of recovery. Our review is de novo because the only issue is the legal standard of recovery. See Crafts v. Pitts, 161 Wash.2d 16, 22, 162 P.3d 382 (2007); Fisher Props., Inc. v. Arden–Mayfair, Inc., 106 Wash.2d 826, 843, 726 P.2d 8 (1986).
</p>

<p>
B
</p>

<p>
¶ 13 Jim and Shannon characterize the measure of recovery as “unjust enrichment” whilst Judith characterizes the measure of recovery as “quantum meruit.” As an initial matter we take this opportunity to conceptually clarify the distinction between “unjust enrichment” and “quantum meruit.” Washington courts have historically used these terms synonymously, but the distinction between them is legally significant. Our purpose is to standardize the nomenclature and eliminate unnecessary multiplicity of terms.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
¶ 14 The two terms are distinct approaches founded on discrete legal theories: contracts {{**1262}} implied in law and contracts implied in fact. See Chandler v. Wash. Toll Bridge Auth., 17 Wash.2d 591, 600, 137 P.2d 97 (1943) (“[T]he law recognizes two classes of implied contracts: those implied in {{*484}} fact, and others implied in law.”). See also Martin v. Campanaro, 156 F.2d 127, 130 n. 5 (2d Cir.1946).
</p>

<p>
[3] ¶ 15 Unjust enrichment is the method of recovery for the value of the benefit retained absent any contractual relationship because notions of fairness and justice require it. See Bailie Commc’ns, Ltd. v. Trend Bus. Sys., Inc., 61 Wash.App. 151, 160, 810 P.2d 12 (1991) (“Unjust enrichment occurs when one retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.”).
</p>

<p>
[4] <a id="orgf5d2dc9"></a> [5] <a id="org0783c9d"></a> [6] <a id="orga5c7e06"></a> ¶ 16 In such situations a quasi contract is said to exist between the parties. Bill v. Gattavara, 34 Wash.2d 645, 650, 209 P.2d 457 (1949) (stating “the terms ‘restitution’ and ‘unjust enrichment’ are the modern designations for the older doctrine of ‘quasi contracts.’ ”); State v. Cont’l Baking Co., 72 Wash.2d 138, 143, 431 P.2d 993 (1967) (“ ‘If the defendant be under an obligation, from the ties of natural justice, to refund; the law implies a debt, and gives this action, founded in the equity of the plaintiff’s case, as it were upon a contract, (quasi ex contractu) &#x2026;.’ ”) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State ex rel. Employment Sec. Bd. v. Rucker, 211 Md. 153, 157–58, 126 A.2d 846 (1956) (quoting Moses v. Macferlan, 2 Burr. 1005, 97 Eng. Rep. 676, 678 (1760))).
</p>

<p>
“Three elements must be established in order to sustain a claim based on unjust enrichment: a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; an appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and the acceptance or retention by the defendant of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without the payment of its value.”
</p>

<p>
Bailie Commc’ns, 61 Wash.App. at 159–60, 810 P.2d 12 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1535–36 (6th ed.1990)). See also Lynch v. Deaconess Med. Ctr., 113 Wash.2d 162, 165, 776 P.2d 681 (1989) (stating elements as “the enrichment of the defendant must be unjust; and &#x2026; the plaintiff cannot be a mere volunteer.”). In other words the elements of a contract implied in law are: (1) the defendant receives a benefit, (2) the received benefit is at the plaintiff’s expense, and (3) the {{*485}} circumstances make it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment.
</p>

<p>
[7] ¶ 17 “Quantum meruit,” on the other hand, is the method of recovering the reasonable value of services provided under a contract implied in fact.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> See, e.g., Eaton v. Engelcke Mfg., Inc., 37 Wash.App. 677, 681 P.2d 1312 (1984) (affirming quantum meruit award on basis of contract implied in fact); see also A.F.A.B., Inc. v. Town of Old Orchard Beach, 639 A.2d 103, 105 n. 3 (Me.1994) (“Quantum meruit denotes recovery for the value of services or materials provided under an actual, implied-in-fact contract.”).5
</p>


<p>
[8] <a id="org80cee37"></a> [9] <a id="org6bb22b0"></a> ¶ 18 A contract implied in fact:
</p>

<p>
is an agreement depending for its existence on some act or conduct of the party {{**1263}} sought to be charged and arising by implication from circumstances which, according to common understanding, show a mutual intention on the part of the parties to contract with each other. The services must be rendered under such circumstances as to indicate that the person rendering them expected to be paid therefor, and that the recipient expected, or should have expected, to pay for them.
</p>

<p>
{{*486}} Johnson v. Nasi, 50 Wash.2d 87, 91, 309 P.2d 380 (1957) (citing Ross v. Raymer, 32 Wash.2d 128, 137, 201 P.2d 129 (1948)). In other words the elements of a contract implied in fact are: (1) the defendant requests work, (2) the plaintiff expects payment for the work, and (3) the defendant knows or should know the plaintiff expects payment for the work.
</p>

<p>
[10] ¶ 19 In sum, “unjust enrichment” is founded on notions of justice and equity whereas “quantum meruit” is founded in the law of contracts, a legally significant distinction. See Bailie Commc’ns, 61 Wash.App. at 160, 810 P.2d 12 (“Thus while quantum meruit, inasmuch as it involves retention of benefits in the form of services received, falls within the unjust enrichment doctrine, unjust enrichment applies to a far broader category of cases.”); see also Candace S. Kovacic, A Proposal to Simplify Quantum Meruit Litigation, 35 AM. U.L.REV. 547, 553–62 (1986) (discussing the confusion surrounding these theories).
</p>

<p>
[11] <a id="org940af29"></a> ¶ 20 After reviewing the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, we find it is unclear whether there was a contract implied in fact or a contract implied in law. Clearly Judith received a benefit at the plaintiff’s expense and the circumstances make it unjust for her to retain that benefit without payment. Equally clear, however, is Judith’s request for the work, Jim’s reasonable expectation of payment for the work, and Judith’s knowledge that Jim expected compensation.
</p>

<p>
¶ 21 Under a contract implied in fact, Jim and Shannon’s recovery would be limited to the value of services rendered. See Bailie Commc’ns, 61 Wash.App. at 160, 810 P.2d 12; Eaton, 37 Wash.App. at 682, 681 P.2d 1312. Nevertheless, Jim and Shannon do not to argue for an implied-in-fact contract. See Cahn v. Foster &amp; Marshall, Inc., 33 Wash.App. 838, 840, 658 P.2d 42 (1983) (stating, “[t]he burden of proving a contract, whether express or implied, is on the party asserting it&#x2026;.”). Therefore, we must determine Judith’s obligation under an implied-in-law contract and the equitable theory of unjust enrichment.
</p>

<p>
{{*487}} C
</p>

<p>
[12] <a id="org3ad525c"></a> ¶ 22 In the abstract the issue is whether the proper measure of recovery under unjust enrichment is the market value of the services rendered or the claimant’s actual cost to render those services. In real terms the issue is whether the trial judge properly deducted $258,5166 from the cost Judith would have paid a normal contractor to perform the work performed by Jim and Shannon, or whether Jim and Shannon are entitled to the full amount despite not incurring certain costs normally incurred in a business relationship
</p>

<p>
6
</p>

<p>
$258,516 is the difference between the total market cost, $760,382, and the amount awarded by the trial judge, $501,866. Alternatively, the trial judge deducted $248,134 from the amount recoverable by Jim and Shannon, which is the difference between the lowest accretion in value attributable to Jim and Shannon’s improvements, $750,000, and the amount awarded by the trial judge.
</p>

<p>
[13] <a id="org5d57b02"></a> ¶ 23 Washington law states the measure of recovery for unjust enrichment to a faultless claimant for the claimant’s improvement to land is measured in one of two ways. It may be measured “by the amount which the benefit conferred would have cost {{**1264}} the defendant had it obtained the benefit from some other person in the plaintiff’s position.” Noel v. Cole, 98 Wash.2d 375, 383, 655 P.2d 245 (1982) (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 371, cmt. b (1981)), superseded by statute as stated in Dioxin/Organochlorine Ctr. v. Pollution Control Hearings Bd., 131 Wash.2d 345, 360, 932 P.2d 158 (1997). Alternatively, it may be measured by “the extent to which the other party’s property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 371(b) (1981); see also Smith v. Favilla, 23 Wash.App. 59, 62–63, 593 P.2d 564 (1979).

[14] ¶ 24 Here, the value of the first measure is $760,382 while the value of the second measure is between $750,000 and $1,050,000. Therefore, under Washington law Jim and Shannon are entitled to an award between $750,000 and $1,050,000. Within this range the trial court, reviewing the {{*488}} complex factual matters involved in the case, has tremendous discretion to fashion a remedy “to do substantial justice to the parties and put an end to the litigation.” Esmieu v. Hsieh, 92 Wash.2d 530, 535, 598 P.2d 1369 (1979); Hough v. Stockbridge, 150 Wash.2d 234, 76 P.3d 216 (2003). Yet here the trial court awarded $501,866, supposing the circumstances of the claimant affected the quantum of recovery. We find no support for this proposition.
</p>

<p>
¶ 25 Certainly, when a court calculates the recovery for unjust enrichment not all cost is recoverable. As stated in the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS, “a party’s expenditures in preparation for performance that do not confer a benefit on the other party do not give rise to a restitution interest.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 370 cmt. a (1981); see also id. § 371 cmt. b (stating, “expenditures are excluded to the extent that they conferred no benefit.”). Here, however, the trial court deducted “mobilization/demobilization costs; the cost of providing supervision, tools and general equipment; the cost for debris disposal; a markup for overhead and profit; and construction contingency; the cost of bonds; insurance and business taxes; and the cost of Washington State sales tax.” CP at 640. Undoubtedly some of these costs conferred a benefit to Judith.
</p>

<p>
¶ 26 Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, the benefits derived from some of these costs are independent of the formality of the relationship. See dissent at 495. For example, Judith benefited by having Jim and Shannon dispose of the debris generated by the improvements she requested. Moreover, Judith benefited by having Jim and Shannon provide tools and equipment. In short, justice requires Judith to pay for the benefit she received from these services.7 The trial court erred in totally deducting all of these costs without an examination of whether these {{*489}} costs had some consequential relationship to the value of the benefit conferred.8 See A.F.A.B., Inc., 639 A.2d at 106 (“Such a blanket exclusion of a plaintiff’s overhead, costs, and profits is improper unless the court determines that they have no meaningful relationship to the value of the benefit conferred and the extent to which a defendant has been enriched.”) (emphasis in original).

“ ‘If the defendant be under an obligation, from the ties of natural justice, to refund; the law implies a debt, and gives this action, founded in the equity of the plaintiff’s case, as it were upon a contract, (quasi ex contractu),&#x2026;.’ ” State v. Cont’l Baking Co., 72 Wash.2d 138, 143, 431 P.2d 993 (1967) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State ex rel. Employment Sec. Bd. v. Rucker, 211 Md. 153, 157–58, 126 A.2d 846 (1956) (quoting Moses v. Macferlan, 2 Burr. 1005, 97 Eng. Rep. 676, 678 (1760))).
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The dissent conflates cost with value, often correlated but not intertwined terms. Dissent at 1266–67. Cost refers to whatever is given to secure the benefit received, whereas value refers to the relative worth of the benefit to the recipient.
</p>

<p>
¶ 27 This approach does not bind the hand of the trial court as the dissent suggests. Dissent at 495-96. To the contrary, we recognize the complexity of informal construction arrangements and demand a careful analysis of the benefits conferred. This approach ensures the defendant remunerates {{**1265}} the faultless claimant for every benefit conferred independent of the formality of the relationship.
</p>

</p>

<p>
¶ 28 Judith argues the court should not be constrained when calculating the unjust enrichment award based on improvements to real property. Instead, Judith argues, the trial court should have broad discretion to fashion a remedy based on the unique facts and circumstances of the parties. Judith’s argument overlooks the focus of an unjust enrichment calculation.
</p>

<p>
¶ 29 The obligation to repay the debt or disgorge the value of the received benefit focuses on the receiver of the benefit, not on the provider of the benefit. See RESTATEMENT OF RESTITUTION: QUASI CONTRACTS AND CONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTS § 155(1) (1937) (stating “the measure of recovery for the benefit thus received is the value of what was received”).
</p>

<p>
[W]here money is awarded to protect a claimant’s restitution interest, it may, depending on what “justice requires,” be measured either by the reasonable value of what the other party has received, as viewed through the eyes of the recipient, by looking to what the recipient would have had to pay {{*490}} someone in the claimant’s position to obtain the goods or services, or by the extent to which the other party’s property has been increased in value&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
26 SAMUEL WILLISTON &amp; RICHARD A. LORD, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 68:35, at 424 (4th ed.2003) (emphasis added).
</p>

<p>
[15] ¶ 30 Judith understands the phrase “in the claimant’s position” to mean the court considers the claimant’s circumstances when calculating his recovery. The claimant’s position, however, refers to similar providers of like services, not the actual claimant; otherwise, the quantum of recovery would always be limited by the claimant’s actual cost. Unjust enrichment recovery is limited only by the claimant’s actual cost when the claimant is at fault. See Noel, 98 Wash.2d at 383 n. 6, 655 P.2d 245 (citing Edwards v. City of Renton, 67 Wash.2d 598, 607, 409 P.2d 153 (1965)). Here, neither Jim nor Shannon was at fault, so they are entitled to full restitution of Judith unjust enrichment. Phrased alternatively, Judith must disgorge the entire value of the benefit she received as determined by either the fair market value of the services rendered or the amount the improvements enhanced the value of the property.
</p>

<p>
¶ 31 Notably, Judith requested the work. Under circumstances where a person asks for and receives valuable improvements to property the person is required to pay the market value of what was received. See RESTATEMENT OF RESTITUTION, supra, § 155, cmt. d (1937) (stating “the fact that [she] asked for them shows that they are of value to [her] &#x2026; and normally [she] would be required to pay the market price of such services&#x2026;.”).
</p>

<p>
[16] <a id="org1d9f4fe"></a> ¶ 32 Judith’s theory of recovery is based on preventing a supposedly unconscionable gain to the claimant. Yet, her theory of recovery permits a defendant to retain some benefit.9 Under circumstances where the claimant is at {{*491}} fault and/or the defendant did not consent to the benefit such a theory of recovery may be sound. See Edwards, 67 Wash.2d at 607, 409 P.2d 153 (limiting the recovery to cost because of violation to bidding statute). But where the claimant is not at fault and the defendant agreed to the improvements, fairness and justice dictate the defendant should be held to pay the entire amount as measured by how much it would have cost the defendant to purchase the improvements or by how much the improvement enhanced the value of the property. See Noel, 98 Wash.2d at 383, 655 P.2d 245; see also RESTATEMENT OF RESTITUTION, supra, § 158, cmt. d (1937) (stating “where it is clear that the owner did desire {{**1266}} improvements, it is fair that [she] should pay for them.”).
</p>

<p>
9
</p>

<p>
In fact, the property increased in value by at least $750,000 on account of Jim and Shannon’s improvements. Limiting recovery to $501,866 allows Judith to retain a windfall of at least $248,134.
</p>

<p>
III. CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
[17] <a id="orgb6c3b81"></a> ¶ 33 We affirm the Court of Appeals. We hold when calculating an unjust enrichment award in a quasi-contract action for improvements to real property the award may not be reduced by the claimant’s actual cost absent fault by the claimant or inconsequential relationship to the benefit conferred to the defendant. We remand to the trial court for recalculation of Jim and Shannon’s award.

¶ 34 The majority insists that a professional, licensed and bonded general contractor is in the same position as Jim and Shannon Young, who were not licensed and bonded as general contractors, did not pay taxes, and performed work on their own time line while living on Judith Young’s property. In so holding, the majority strips trial judges of the discretion to craft appropriate equitable remedies in unjust enrichment cases.
</p>

<p>
¶ 35 Additionally, in its discussion of implied contract theory, the majority changes—it does not merely “clarify”—the definition of the long-used common-law phrase “quantum {{*492}} meruit.” The majority does not adequately acknowledge this change, nor does it support the change in a principled way.

<p>
The Measure of Recovery in Unjust Enrichment Actions
</p>

<p>
¶ 37 Jim and Shannon10 brought a quasi-contract or unjust enrichment claim. At issue here is the proper application of the “reasonable value of services” measure of recovery for unjust enrichment, set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. The Restatement, section 371, adopted by this court in Noel v. Cole, 98 Wash.2d 375, 655 P.2d 245 (1982), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Dioxin/Organochlorine Center v. Pollution Control Hearings Board, 131 Wash.2d 345, 362, 932 P.2d 158 (1997), states that unjust enrichment recovery11 may be measured as “the reasonable value to the other party of what [she] received in terms of what it would have cost [her] to obtain it from a person in the claimant’s position.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 371(a) (1981).

<p>
For ease in identification, we refer to the parties by their first names as they are identified in the parties’ briefings.
</p>

<p>
11
</p>

<p>
The Restatement, section 371, describes restitution. The remedy for unjust enrichment is restitution. See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1573–74 (8th ed.2004); 1 ARTHUR LINTON CORBIN &amp; JOSEPH M. PERILLO, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 1.20, at 63 (rev. ed.1993).
</p>

<p>
¶ 38 I agree with the majority that a person “in the claimant’s position” means a “similar provider[ ] of like services.” Majority at 490. Jim and Shannon urge us to calculate the “reasonable value” of the benefit as the sum Judith would have paid a professional general contractor to perform the work. But Jim and Shannon are dissimilar to professional general contractors.12 They undertook to perform the work on an informal basis, on their own time line, {{*493}} while living on the property. They were not licensed, bonded, or insured as general contractors. They paid no state taxes; they incurred no overhead costs. The court was correct to measure the value of their services as informal contractors, not professional general contractors.
</p>

<p>
12
</p>

<p>
Jim was not a licensed and bonded general contractor. Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 659. The findings of fact state that Jim was licensed and bonded for the activities of “timber cutting, clearing, grading, dozing, and concrete slab construction.” CP at 618. The activities in which he engaged far exceeded the scope of this list. See CP at 219–27.
</p>

<p>
¶ 39 Contrary to the majority’s assertion, this reading of “in the claimant’s position” does not ignore the fact that the remedy of restitution should cause the recipient of the benefit to disgorge that benefit in full. See majority at 490. Instead, this approach recognizes {{**1267}} that receiving the benefit from informal workers reduces the actual value of the benefit, largely because the recipient bears increased risk. For example, no performance bond guarantees that the project will be completed. If a construction accident occurs for which the recipient could be liable or if construction defects surface, the recipient lacks insurance protection. The recipient cannot seek recourse with the state Department of Licensing if she is unsatisfied with the work. There is no doubt that the provider’s circumstances affect the work’s value to the recipient, thus trial judges may adjust recovery accordingly.
</p>

<p>
¶ 40 Our case law and the Restatement show that the trial judge had ample discretion when fashioning the remedy in this case. Initially, the majority correctly notes that unjust enrichment is an equitable doctrine.13 Precisely for that reason, there can be no strict rule for calculating “reasonable value of services” recovery in an unjust enrichment action. See 26 SAMUEL WILLISTON &amp; RICHARD A. LORD, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 68:36, at 445 &amp; n. 89 (4th ed.2003). “ ‘[E]quitable doctrines grew naturally out of the humane desire to relieve [parties] under special circumstances {{*494}} from the harshness of strict legal rules.’ ” Kingery v. Dep’t of Labor &amp; Indus., 132 Wash.2d 162, 173–74, 937 P.2d 565 (1997) (quoting Ames v. Dep’t of Labor &amp; Indus., 176 Wash. 509, 513, 30 P.2d 239 (1934)). When fashioning equitable remedies, trial courts’ aim is “to do substantial justice to the parties.” See Esmieu v. Hsieh, 92 Wash.2d 530, 535, 598 P.2d 1369 (1979); Hough v. Stockbridge, 150 Wash.2d 234, 236, 76 P.3d 216 (2003). To that end, trial courts sitting in equity must look to the circumstances surrounding each case when determining remedies. Esmieu, 92 Wash.2d at 535, 598 P.2d 1369.
</p>

<p>
13
</p>

<p>
Though quasi-contract doctrine developed in the common law, and thus unjust enrichment actions are often considered “legal” in nature, the doctrine is squarely founded on equitable principles. 26 SAMUEL WILLISTON &amp; RICHARD A. LORD, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 68:1, at 24–25 (4th ed.2003). A party is liable in an unjust enrichment action when she possesses another’s money or property and “ ‘in equity and good conscience, [she] ought not to retain it.’ ” Heaton v. Imus, 93 Wash.2d 249, 252, 608 P.2d 631 (1980) (quoting Bill v. Gattavara, 34 Wash.2d 645, 650, 209 P.2d 457 (1949)).
</p>

<p>
¶ 41 The Restatement rule for “reasonable value” recovery contemplates this flexible approach to calculating awards. As noted above, it states that “reasonable value” is “what [the other party] received in terms of what it would have cost [her] to obtain it from a person in the claimant’s position.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 371(a) (1981) (emphasis added). Further, the Restatement acknowledges that the measure of “reasonable value” is “usually based on the market price of &#x2026; a substitute.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 371 cmt. a, at 203 (1981) (emphasis added). The Restatement invites courts sitting in equity to consider the claimant’s position, using market value as a starting point.
</p>

<p>
¶ 42 In Noel, this court established that the court may take a plaintiff’s circumstances into account when calculating the amount of recovery. 98 Wash.2d at 383, 655 P.2d 245. In Noel, an unjust enrichment case about improvements to state timber lands, this court remanded to the trial court for a computation of recovery. Id. at 383–84, 655 P.2d 245. This court ordered the trial court to allow the plaintiff to prove the “reasonable value” of its improvements. Id. at 383, 655 P.2d 245. Specifically, this court advised the trial court that the reasonable value of the services “might be either more or less” than cost, plainly intending to allow the trial court to consider the circumstances of the case when determining “reasonable value.” Id.
</p>

<p>
¶ 43 Other Washington cases have taken a flexible approach and used factors other than strict “market value” in {{*495}} calculating reasonable value awards. In Losli v. Foster, 37 Wash.2d 220, 232, 222 P.2d 824 (1950), this court used “the actual cost to appellant of the labor and materials supplied” as the basis for its calculations.14 In Heaton v. Imus, 93 Wash.2d 249, 254, 608 P.2d 631 (1980), this {{**1268}} court recognized that lost profits may also factor into the calculation at a trial court’s discretion. This sort of flexibility is crucial in fashioning remedies that do equity to the parties.
</p>

<p>
14
</p>

<p>
The majority cites Noel for the proposition that “[u]njust enrichment recovery is limited only by the claimant’s actual cost when the claimant is at fault.” Majority at 1265 (citing Noel, 98 Wash.2d at 383 n. 6, 655 P.2d 245). First, the record gives no indication that the trial judge found himself legally constrained to limit Jim and Shannon’s recovery to cost. He simply seems to have decided that a measure of recovery that approximated cost was the most appropriate for the situation. Second, the Noel passage cited by the majority does not state a clear rule that cost is a limit only when the claimant is at fault. Noel says, “In general, a court should not limit maximum recovery to cost as was directed in Edwards&#x2026;. That limitation was justified there because the statute violated was a bidding statute.” 98 Wash.2d at 383 n. 6, 655 P.2d 245. (citing Edwards v. City of Renton, 67 Wash.2d 598, 607, 409 P.2d 153 (1965)). In Edwards, the claimant was a shopping center that agreed with the city to pay for a traffic light and to be reimbursed later. 67 Wash.2d at 600, 409 P.2d 153. The defendant city, not the claimant shopping center, violated the bidding statute by agreeing to pay for the signal without taking bids for its construction. Id. at 602–03, 409 P.2d 153. In these special circumstances, the court concluded that the recovery should be what the low bid would have been, not to exceed the amount actually paid. Id. at 607, 409 P.2d 153.
</p>

<p>
¶ 44 Here, when Jim and Shannon brought an unjust enrichment claim, they asked the trial judge to sit in equity. Accordingly, the trial judge had broad discretion to fashion a remedy that did substantial justice to the parties. By deducting general contractors’ costs from the expert’s cost estimate, the trial judge awarded “reasonable value” of the benefit in terms of what it would have cost Judith to obtain it in an informal arrangement with other parties who were not professional general contractors. The remedy he ordered here was well within the bounds of his discretion under the doctrine of unjust enrichment.
</p>

<p>
¶ 45 Informal arrangements for home improvement and construction are common, especially in rural areas, and they present a dizzying variety of circumstances for trial judges to consider. By limiting trial judges to strict market value of professional contracting services as the measure of “reasonable value,” the majority ties the hands of trial {{*496}} judges when faced with nuanced conflicts arising from these informal construction arrangements. I dissent.
</p>

<p>
The Meaning of “Quantum Meruit”
</p>

<p>
¶ 46 The majority also devotes a number of pages to a discussion of implied contract theory, and its outline of the distinction between implied-in-law and implied-in-fact contracts may prove useful. However, in that discussion, the majority makes an unannounced and unprincipled change to the definition of the phrase “quantum meruit,” a change that may be confusing to litigants and courts alike.
</p>

<p>
¶ 47 In examining this change in the definition of “quantum meruit,” we must first note that payment of the “reasonable value” of services rendered is a remedy for breach of both types of implied contracts: contracts implied in fact and contracts implied in law. Implied-in-law contracts are also called “quasi contracts,” and they seek to remedy “unjust enrichment,” thus all three terms are regularly used to describe the action itself. The remedy in an unjust enrichment action is restitution, see BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1573–74 (8th ed.2004), which is measured as either: (1) the reasonable value of the services or (2) the increase in value of the recipient’s property, RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS  § 371(a), (b) (1981). The remedy for breach of an implied-in-fact contract is simply the reasonable value of services. Eaton v. Engelcke Mfg., Inc., 37 Wash.App. 677, 682, 681 P.2d 1312 (1984).
</p>

<p>
¶ 48 At least until now, “quantum meruit” simply has been the Latin shorthand for the “reasonable value” measure of recovery, regardless of whether the plaintiff sought recovery under a contract implied in law (quasi contract, unjust enrichment) or a contract implied in fact. 1 ARTHUR LINTON CORBIN &amp; JOSEPH M. PERILLO, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 4.5, at 596 (rev. ed. 1993) (“ ‘Reasonable value’ is often expressed in the law-[L]atin phrase quantum meruit. {{**1269}} This phrase, or its English equivalent, reasonable value, is used in express or implied-in-fact contracts, and in quasi contract cases.” (footnote omitted));  {{*497}} Heaton, 93 Wash.2d at 252–53, 608 P.2d 631 (stating that “[q]uantum meruit is not a legal obligation like quasi contract, but is rather a remedy: ‘a reasonable amount for work done,’ ” granting “quantum meruit” recovery on the basis of a quasi-contract claim); Black’s, supra, at 1276 (“the reasonable value of services.”); Eaton, 37 Wash.App. at 680, 681 P.2d 1312 (stating that quantum meruit applied in quasi-contract and implied-in-fact contract cases.); Bailie Commc’ns, Ltd. v. Trend Bus. Sys., Inc., 61 Wash.App. 151, 159, 810 P.2d 12 (1991) (“ ‘ “Quantum meruit” as amount of recovery &#x2026; measures recovery under implied contract to pay compensation as reasonable value of services rendered.’ ” (quoting BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1243 (6th ed.1990))). The term “quantum meruit” logically describes a measure of recovery for both implied-in-law and implied-in-fact contracts, because both can be remedied by a “reasonable value” recovery, for which the phrase “quantum meruit” is merely a shorthand description.
</p>

<p>
¶ 49 The majority now states, as though it were an unshakable historical premise, that the term “quantum meruit” can be used only in the context of a contract implied in fact. Majority at 484. The majority cites to Eaton for the proposition that quantum meruit recovery applies to contracts implied in fact (presumably to the exclusion of contracts implied in law/quasi contracts). Majority at 485. Eaton, however, clearly demonstrates an expansive usage of the term:
</p>

<p>
The remedy of quantum meruit applies in a variety of situations. See Heaton &#x2026;, [93 Wash.2d 249, 608 P.2d 631] (quasi contract); Lester N. Johnson Co. v. [City of] Spokane, 22 Wash.App. 265, 588 P.2d 1214 (1978) (when parties enter into a contract and substantial change not within their contemplation later occurs); Dravo Corp. v. L.W. Moses Co., 6 Wash.App. 74, 492 P.2d 1058 (1971) (restitution for part performance); Kintz v. Read, 28 Wash.App. 731, 626 P.2d 52 (1981); Hopkins v. Anderson, 7 Wash.App. 762, 502 P.2d 473 (1972) (implied in fact contract to pay the reasonable value for services rendered).
</p>

<p>
37 Wash.App. at 680–81, 681 P.2d 1312. The majority’s only other support for restricting the use of the term “quantum meruit” to implied-in-fact {{*498}} contract situations is a Maine case. The majority then goes on, in a footnote, to dismiss the significance of two cases from this court that gave “quantum meruit” awards based on contracts implied in law.
</p>

<p>
¶ 50 The majority tells us that the distinction between “quantum meruit” recovery and recovery under an unjust enrichment (implied-in-law contract) theory is “legally significant” because one is equitable while the other is legal. Majority at 486. But the “legal significance” lies in the nature of the underlying cause of action, not the name of the measure of recovery. The term “quantum meruit” as the name for a remedy garnered this kind of “legal significance” for the first time today, when the majority declared that it could no longer be used in the implied-in-law contract context.
</p>

<p>
¶ 51 Of course, this court is entitled to change its mind. It has the prerogative to decide that “quantum meruit” describes “reasonable value” recovery under implied-in-fact contracts, and to banish the term from the discussion of “reasonable value” recovery under implied-in-law contracts. After all, because the majority does not change the substance of implied contract claims, the distinction is purely semantic.
</p>

<p>
¶ 52 But when this court changes the definition of a long-used common-law term, it should be clear about it. It should inform future litigants that they can no longer rely on the dictionary definition of the term, see BLACK’S, supra, at 1276, nor on the explanations in major treatises, see 26 LORD, supra, § 68:1, at 5. And it should make such a change for a well-articulated reason. The majority does not do so.
</p>

<p>
¶ 53 Because this court and future litigants should be apprised of this change, and because {{**1270}} the majority inadvisably constrains the discretion of trial judges to do equity to the parties in unjust enrichment cases involving informal construction agreements, I write in dissent.

Bignold v. King County, 65 Wash.2d 817, 826, 399 P.2d 611 (1965) (citing Schuehle v. City of Seattle, 199 Wash. 675, 92 P.2d 1109 (1939)). In addition “Quantum meruit” has been used to measure recovery for part performance. See Dravo Corp. v. L.W. Moses Co., 6 Wash.App. 74, 492 P.2d 1058 (1971). In each of these instances, however, some underlying contractual relationship between the parties affects the measure of recovery. See id. at 91–92, 492 P.2d 1058. Hence the quantum meruit recovery falls under a contract implied in fact theory.

COLEMAN, J.
</p>

<p>
{{*1}} Greg Kendall sued his former landlord, Joe Klein, after he vacated Klein’s property. Kendall appeals the trial court’s finding that he was not entitled to damages for the lack of potable water to the property or for Klein’s failure to make certain repairs. He also argues that he should have been reimbursed for the labor he expended making repairs to the property. Because the record supports all of the trial court’s findings as to damages and reimbursements due to Kendall, we affirm those findings. We do, however, reverse the court’s award of attorney fees to Klein.
</p>

<p>
IFACTS
</p>

<p>
Kendall began renting property in Blaine from Klein on September 1, 1998. The piece of property had multiple buildings on it, and Kendall intended to use his portion of the property as both his residence and for his tree service business. Klein also lived on the property in a recreational vehicle. When Kendall contracted with Klein and commenced his tenancy, there was no Blaine City Water service to the house. The water service had been terminated months earlier due to a billing dispute between the city and Klein. Kendall knew there was no water service, but there was a well on the property and Klein told Kendall he could use the well water while he handled the billing dispute with the city. Kendall was not satisfied with the well water because a test had revealed it was unsatisfactory, and Klein addressed the problem by providing Kendall with five gallons of bottled water per week. Kendall continued to use well water for bathing and other nondrinking purposes. Blaine City Water was not reconnected to the property until August 18, 1999—347 days after Kendall’s lease commenced.
</p>

<p>
The house and property had many physical and structural defects, and Kendall notified Klein of these defects. From October 1998 to November 1999, Kendall deducted his repair expenses from his rent payments. In December 1999, Klein hired a property manager, and the manager discontinued the deductions because there had not been a deduction agreement in writing.
</p>

<p>
Kendall gave Klein written notice in January 2000 of remaining defects on the property, but Klein did not repair any of these defects. Kendall remained on the property despite the defects. Later that spring, when he discovered that operating his business did not comply with the zoning requirements of the property, Kendall began searching for a more suitable location. He vacated Klein’s property on July 30, 2000. After moving out, Kendall sued Klein, claiming, inter alia, that he had breached duties under the Residential Landlord–Tenant Act (RLTA) by not providing water service, that he had intentionally terminated his tenant’s water supply within the meaning of RCW 59.18.300, that he had breached an oral contract to reimburse Kendall for out-of-pocket costs and labor expended making repairs to the property, and that he had breached his duty to repair defects after written notice was provided.
</p>

<p>
The trial court ruled that Klein had breached his duty to provide water service to his tenant and his duty to repair and that he had agreed to reimburse Kendall’s out-of-pocket expenses. Kendall was awarded $5,159.89 for out-of-pocket expenses and $5,000 in attorney fees. The trial court offset Kendall’s attorney fees award by $1,000, for an award to Klein for successfully defending Kendall’s claim that he intentionally terminated Kendall’s water supply. The trial court refused to award Kendall any rent deduction during the period where Blaine City Water service was not connected to the property and also denied his claim for a rent deduction under RCW 59 .18.110 for alleged structural and safety defects in the property that Klein did not repair. Kendall appeals, asserting five assignments of error.
</p>

<p>
ANALYSIS
</p>

<p>
Termination of Utilities
</p>

<p>
{{*2}} RCW 59.18.300 awards a tenant $100 for each day a landlord unlawfully terminates utilities to the leased property. Kendall argues that this statute applies to the situation here and therefore argues it was error for the trial court to deny his request for the award for 347 days without water service. Klein argues that this statute covers a different situation—one where the landlord terminates services during the lease.
</p>

<p>
Kendall correctly points out that the statute does not specify that the termination of water service must occur during the lease in order to trigger the $100 a day award. But it is not logical to assume that an RCW 59.18.300 termination could occur before the start of a tenancy because the statute uses the language “landlord” and “tenant,” and before a lease exists, there is no landlord or tenant. Furthermore, another section of the RLTA more closely addresses the situation here:
</p>

<p>
The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keep the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant.
</p>

<p>
RCW 59.18.060. It is clear that the utilities termination section is intended to prohibit landlords from attempting to evict tenants by cutting off utilities service, but that situation did not occur here. Because the trial court applied the RLTA section that logically applies to this situation—lack of water as a breach of landlord’s duty to maintain habitability rather than as an intentional termination—we affirm the trial court’s refusal to award damages under RCW 59.18.300.
</p>

<p>
Rent Reimbursement
</p>

<p>
Kendall requested a return of all rent he paid to Klein during the 347 days there was no water service to the property. The trial court found that because Kendall remained on the property, even without water, he “got his money’s worth.” Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Aug. 31, 2004) at 138. Kendall acknowledges that he did not vacate the premises (he testified he could not afford to move), but he argues he had the right to request the return of rental payments, based on the diminished value of the lease due to the lack of water, without vacating. See RCW 59.18.110(1)(b); Luxon v. Caviezel, 42 Wn.App. 261, 266 (noting that a house purchaser need not move off the property to prove breach of an implied warranty of habitability).
</p>

<p>
The court, in its findings of fact and conclusions of law, stated that Klein breached his duties under the RLTA by not providing water service but then did not award any damages to Kendall. The proper measure of damages for a breach of a landlord’s duties under RCW 59.18.060 is the difference between the value of the lease as warranted and the value of the lease with the defects. RCW 59.18.110(1)(b). Thus, if Kendall had proved that the lease’s value was diminished because of the lack of water, the trial court could have awarded a partial or complete return of rent paid.
</p>

<p>
{{*3}} A damage award cannot be speculative, but must be reasonably certain. Larsen v. Walton Plywood Co., 65 Wn.2d 1, 16, 390 P.2d 677 (1964). Kendall, however, did not put forth any evidence about the diminished value of the property without potable water. He testified about the inconvenience that resulted from the lack of potable water, but never placed a value on that inconvenience or opined about a diminished value. He also did not bring forth any expert witnesses to testify about the diminished value. The only evidence about the value of the lease was Kendall and Klein’s testimony agreeing that $600 a month was a low price for the property and that they arrived at that price because the property had so many defects. Without putting forward any evidence as to the damages flowing from the breach of Klein’s duty to provide potable water to the property, Kendall was not entitled to a rent reduction and the trial court’s finding of no reimbursement is supported by the evidence.
</p>

<p>
Reimbursement of Labor Costs
</p>

<p>
Kendall testified that he and Klein agreed that Kendall would be reimbursed $15 per hour for any labor he expended making repairs to the property. Klein did not support or refute this testimony specifically; he did testify that they did not make arrangements for reimbursement except in a few specific circumstances—they had no ongoing understanding. Kendall submitted exhibits consisting of all the receipts for costs expended making repairs to the property, which included an amount for his own labor (not broken down by hour or explained beyond the final total). The court, however, found that Kendall was not entitled to an award for his labor because such costs “[had not been] contemplated by the parties.”
</p>

<p>
Klein argues that because he testified that there was no formal arrangement about reimbursement, the court could have inferred from that testimony that the parties did not contemplate reimbursement for Kendall’s labor. Furthermore, Klein asserts that because Kendall deducted out-of-pocket expenses, but not costs for his own labor, from his rent checks, and because Kendall never asked for reimbursement for his labor prior to filing suit, the court’s finding was supported by substantial evidence.
</p>

<p>
This court reviews findings of fact for substantial evidence. Landmark Dev., Inc. v. City of Roy, 138 Wn.2d 561, 573, 980 P.2d 1234 (1999). Here, the trial record contains both Kendall’s testimony about the reimbursement arrangement and Klein’s testimony disputing the existence of such an arrangement. Klein also testified that Kendall never asked for reimbursement for his labor prior to filing suit and that he had never deducted labor costs from his rent checks (but only deducted out-of-pocket expenses). We thus affirm the trial court’s judgment as to the credibility of the conflicting testimony because it is supported by substantial evidence.
</p>

<p>
Failure to Make Repairs
</p>

<p>
Kendall testified that he gave Klein written notice of property defects, but Klein did not make any of the repairs. Because these defects remained, Kendall argued that he should receive a rent reduction of $300 per month for the seven months the defects persisted before he vacated the property.
</p>

<p>
{{*4}} When a landlord has notice of property defects but fails to make repairs, the tenant may sue and recover damages for the landlord’s breach. The measure of damages is the diminution in rental value of the premises caused by the defects. Pappas v. Zerwoodis, 21 Wn.2d 725, 153 P.2d 170 (1944). As with the rental reimbursement Kendall sought for the lack of water, he again failed to prove how much the lease’s value was diminished because of the defects. Without any evidence as to the diminished value of the lease, the trial court had no basis to award a rental reimbursement and we affirm its refusal to do so.
</p>

<p>
Klein’s Attorney Fees at Trial
</p>

<p>
The trial court awarded attorney fees to both Kendall and Klein, with Klein’s smaller award offsetting Kendall’s award. Klein’s attorney did not enter declarations or evidence of any kind explaining the attorney fees accrued in this case. When questioned by the court, Klein’s attorney orally estimated the amount that he (and another attorney not present) was owed on the case, but admitted he did not have any paperwork or accounting to support his $4,500 estimate. Kendall objected to this request for fees without supporting documentation. The court explained, without clarity, why it was awarding attorney fees to Klein:
</p>

<p>
What I’m going to do &#x2026; is award the plaintiff $5,000 in attorney’s fees, and down below I’ll award the defendant $1,000 in attorney’s fees. And that’s because of the—while I’m not taking the actual causes of action, I’m waiting; I think because of the wait I’ll make your client pay.
</p>

<p>
VRP (Aug. 31, 2004) at 142.
</p>

<p>
Kendall argues on appeal that Klein was not entitled to any attorney fees because his attorney had not made any declaration about fees to support the court’s award, but he cites no authority for this position. Klein argues that because he successfully defended Kendall’s claim that RCW 59.18.300 (which authorizes an attorney fees award to the prevailing party) applied to the case, the court acted within its discretion to grant an award to him.
</p>

<p>
Because it is undisputed that Klein prevailed on the issue of RCW 59.18.300’s applicability, Klein would have been entitled to attorney fees. But Klein’s attorney admitted to the court that he had not prepared declarations delineating the requested fees. He estimated that he had incurred $4,500 in attorney fees overall, but did not specify how much was spent on the claims on which he prevailed. The court chose to award Klein $1,000 in attorney fees, without investigating further into the basis for a fee award. Attorney fees awards “should be based on more than just estimation or conjecture.” Austin v. U.S. Bank, 73 Wn.App. 293, 310, 869 P.2d 404 (1994). Washington courts have been clear that this state follows the “lodestar” methodology for determining attorney fee awards, and this methodology requires documentation of the work performed. McGreevy v. Oregon Mut. Ins. Co., 90 Wn.App. 283, 291–92, 951 P.2d 798 (1998). Minimally, such documentation must include the number of hours worked, the type of work performed, and the category of attorney who performed the work. McGreevy, 90 Wn.App. at 292. Because Klein’s attorney provided no such documentation, Klein’s attorney fee award was improper and we reverse, crediting Klein’s award back to Kendall.
</p>

<p>
Attorney Fees on Appeal
</p>

<p>
{{*5}} Kendall argues that because he was awarded attorney fees below, he should be awarded attorney fees on appeal if he proves to be the prevailing party. Klein argues that because there was no statutory basis for the award to Kendall below (because the authorizing statute cited by the trial court does not actually contain an attorney fee provision), Kendall should not be awarded attorney fees by this court.
</p>

<p>
Although both parties were awarded fees below, neither party should have been awarded fees. The court erroneously based its award to Kendall on a statute (RCW 59.18.060) that does not provide for fees, and Klein did not provide the requisite proof to support his estimate of attorney fees. Because Klein does not challenge Kendall’s award below, that award stands. Because it should not have been granted, Kendall would not be permitted to collect attorney fees on appeal even if he were the prevailing party. But as he is not the prevailing party, Kendall is not entitled to collect attorney fees on appeal in any event and we reject his request for fees.
</p>

<p>
Although Klein should not have been granted fees below because of the lack of proof, an award was statutorily authorized and he prevailed on this issue on appeal. Thus, we award Klein appellate attorney fees on the issue of the applicability of RCW 59.18.300 if he complies with the requirements of RAP 18.1.
</p>

<p>
We affirm in part, but reverse Klein’s attorney fee award.
</p>

<p>
{{*385}} ¶ 1 Ianthia Pleasant was evicted from public housing administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Pasco and Franklin County (Housing Authority) for lease violations. In the Housing Authority’s ensuing unlawful detainer action, the trial court issued a writ of restitution of premises at a show cause hearing. Ms. Pleasant vacated the premises and appealed. She contends the writ issued on insufficient and incompetent evidence and she was entitled to a trial. We agree, reverse, and remand for trial.
</p>

<p>
{{*386}} FACTS
</p>

<p>
¶ 2 On July 18, 2003, the Housing Authority filed an eviction summons and complaint for unlawful detainer against Ms. Pleasant. The complaint alleged two bases for eviction involving lease violations. The first charged a variety of lease violations over the preceding year, including the most recent failure of a semiannual inspection of the premises. The Housing Authority served a 30–day notice terminating tenancy on March 27. An informal hearing through the agency was decided against her. Her request for a formal hearing was denied as untimely. The second basis for eviction alleged a lease violation for criminal activity for which Ms. Pleasant was served a three-day notice to terminate. The Housing Authority contended that Ms. Pleasant engaged in prohibited criminal activity, as evidenced by her arrest on May 21, 2003. She was charged with third degree assault of a child when she struck her 13–year–old son several times with a plastic clothes hanger because he failed to obey her. The charge was reduced to fourth degree assault, a misdemeanor, on May 27.

¶ 3 Ms. Pleasant filed a written answer to the complaint and a counterclaim. She denied the contentions and alleged harassment and/or discrimination on the basis of disability and race.
</p>

<p>
¶ 4 On December 5, 2003, the Housing Authority filed a motion for an order to show cause why a writ of restitution should not issue. The court entered an order to show cause on December 8. A show cause hearing was scheduled for December 22. Ms. Pleasant opposed the issuance of the writ by filing an affidavit in which she challenged the facts for the Housing Authority’s first basis for eviction (the multiple violations). A friend of Ms. Pleasant’s also filed an affidavit that contradicted these facts. On the second basis for eviction (the assault arrest) she countered that the misdemeanor to which she pleaded guilty while acting pro se was not a crime for which eviction was appropriate as it did not endanger other tenants. She also pointed out she had never had her children taken away because of abuse.
</p>

<p>
{{*387}} ¶ 5 On December 22, 2003, the trial court issued a writ of restitution. The judge took no testimony. On December 23, the sheriff served a notice to terminate by December 31 or face forceful eviction. Ms. Pleasant vacated and filed this appeal. She seeks to regain housing through the Housing Authority’s facilities.

DISCUSSION
</p>

<p>
STANDARD OF REVIEW
</p>

<p>
[1] <a id="org7eb8ed7"></a> ¶ 6 When the record consists entirely of written material, an appellate court stands in the same position as the trial court and reviews the record de novo. Progressive Animal Welfare Soc’y v. Univ. of Wash., 125 Wash.2d 243, 252, 884 P.2d 592 (1994); {{**425}} Amren v. City of Kalama, 131 Wash.2d 25, 32, 929 P.2d 389 (1997). Additionally, the dispositive issue in this case is the procedural requirements under the unlawful detainer statutes. Issues of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. Hartson P’ship v. Goodwin, 99 Wash.App. 227, 231, 991 P.2d 1211 (2000).
</p>

<p>
MOOTNESS
</p>

<p>
[2] <a id="org3461515"></a> [3] <a id="org06ab44c"></a> ¶ 7 “ ‘A case is technically moot if the court cannot provide the basic relief originally sought, or can no longer provide effective relief.’ ” Josephinium Assocs. v. Kahli, 111 Wash.App. 617, 622, 45 P.3d 627 (2002) (quoting Snohomish County v. State, 69 Wash.App. 655, 660, 850 P.2d 546 (1993)). The Housing Authority argues that since Ms. Pleasant does not have possession of the premises, the appeal is moot. However, the law draws a distinction between possession and the right of possession. Kessler v. Nielsen, 3 Wash.App. 120, 126, 472 P.2d 616 (1970).
</p>

<p>
[4] <a id="org9e295db"></a> [5] <a id="orgc7995fa"></a> [6] <a id="org2075fb1"></a> ¶ 8 “ ‘[O]ne may have a right to the possession as against another who has the possession, as in the simple case of one who has been ousted from the land by another.”’ Id. (quoting 1 HERBERT THORNDIKE TIFFANY, THE LAW OF REAL PROPERTY § 20, at 28 (Basil Jones ed., 3d ed. 1939)). In an unlawful detainer context, it is the right to possession that is pivotal, not mere present possession. {{*388}} Little v. Catania, 48 Wash.2d 890, 893, 297 P.2d 255 (1956); First Union Mgmt., Inc. v. Slack, 36 Wash.App. 849, 853–54, 679 P.2d 936 (1984); Motoda v. Donohoe, 1 Wash.App. 174, 175, 459 P.2d 654 (1969). When the right to possession is at issue, the issue is not moot. Lochridge v. Natsuhara, 114 Wash. 326, 330, 194 P. 974 (1921). The Washington Supreme Court has specifically held that an unlawful detainer case is not moot simply because the tenant does not have possession of the premises at the time of appeal. Id. “[E]ven though the [landlords] were in possession at the time of the appeal, the [tenants] who were still asserting their possessory right had to be precluded as to this right. The action was not moot until this issue had been determined vis-à-vis the parties.” Kessler, 3 Wash.App. at 126, 472 P.2d 616. Here, Ms. Pleasant continues to assert a right to possession. The issue is therefore not moot.
</p>

<p>
¶ 9 The Housing Authority relies on Josephinium, 111 Wash.App. 617, 45 P.3d 627. In that case, Division One of this court, without discussion or citation to authority, held that the tenant’s evacuation during the pendency of the action mooted the issue. Id. at 622, 45 P.3d 627. Neither the legal nor the factual basis upon which Division One determined the issue to be moot is clear. The court did not consider the tenant’s right to possession when addressing mootness.1 Nonetheless, Josephinium is distinguishable on its facts. The unlawful detainer in Josephinium was based upon the landlord’s refusal of the tenant’s tender of a reduced rent payment. The case before us does not deal with failure to pay rent. Additionally, the court in Josephinium appears to have decided the issue was moot because the tenant vacated voluntarily, i.e., without compulsion of a writ. See Kato v. Union Oil Co., 91 Wash. 302, 157 P. 688 (1916) (holding that return of property was not a voluntary {{*389}} satisfaction of the judgment even where appellant neither sought stay of execution nor gave supersedeas bond); Proctor v. Appleby, 110 Wash. 403, 411–12, 188 P. 481 (1920) (holding that surrender of stock in compliance with judgment before appeal perfected did not amount to a cessation of the controversy thereby barring appeal); Josevig–Kennecott Copper Co. v. James F. Howarth Co., 26<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> F. 567, 568 (9th Cir.1919) (applying Washington law and determining that where stock was transferred to the plaintiff after time that supersedeas bond could be had, and transfer was made under threat of contempt, transfer did not affect right to appeal). That is also not the case here.
</p>


<p>
{{**426}} [7] <a id="orgaeaa1af"></a> [8] <a id="org4925fba"></a> [9] <a id="orge0b9416"></a> ¶ 10 Once an unlawful detainer action is commenced and the defendant does not concede the right to possession, the defendant has the right to have the issue determined. Kessler, 3 Wash.App. at 126–27, 472 P.2d 616. A tenant’s relinquishment of the property does not necessarily mean the right to possession is undisputed. Sullivan v. Purvis, 90 Wash.App. 456, 459, 966 P.2d 912 (1998). An issue is not moot if a court can still provide effective relief. State v. Turner, 98 Wash.2d 731, 733, 658 P.2d 658 (1983). Here, the right to possession is disputed. We can determine whether Ms. Pleasant’s right to possession was wrongfully terminated by the improper issuance of a writ and provide relief by restoring her possession.
</p>

<p>
BOND REQUIREMENT
</p>

<p>
[10] <a id="org0971622"></a> ¶ 11 The Housing Authority argues that since Ms. Pleasant did not seek to retain possession of the premises and post a bond pending appeal, she has no right to appeal. RCW 59.18.390(1) provides that within three days of the service of the writ of restitution, the tenant
</p>

<p>
may execute to the plaintiff a bond to be filed with and approved by the clerk of the court in such sum as may be fixed by the judge, with sufficient surety to be approved by the clerk of the court, conditioned that they will pay to the plaintiff such sum as the plaintiff may recover for the use and occupation of the premises, or any rent found due, together with all damages {{*390}} the plaintiff may sustain by reason of the defendant occupying or keeping possession of the premises.
</p>

<p>
(Emphasis added.) The legislature’s use of “may” instead of “must” makes it permissive. Canyon Lumber Co. v. Sexton, 93 Wash. 620, 626, 161 P. 841 (1916).
</p>

<p>
[11] <a id="orga8a90ca"></a> ¶ 12 RCW 59.12.200 provides that “if the [tenant] appealing desires a stay of proceedings pending review, the [tenant] shall execute and file a bond.” (Emphasis added.) RCW 59.12.220 provides that if a writ of restitution has been issued and executed, then the posting of the bond entitles the tenant to be restored to possession of the premises, where the tenant is entitled to remain until the appeal is determined. A bond is required only if the tenant wishes to continue to occupy the premises pending trial. It is to secure the landlord against losses during the pendency of the proceedings when the tenant continues to occupy the premises. RCW 59.18.390.
</p>

<p>
[12] <a id="org9cc13ab"></a> [13] <a id="orgd5aabc6"></a> ¶ 13 The bond need be filed only if the tenant seeks a stay pending review. A bond is not a jurisdictional condition precedent to the maintenance of an appeal under the unlawful detainer statutory scheme.
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS FOR PENDENTE LITE WRIT
</p>

<p>
¶ 14 Since the dispute involves a residential lease we apply the Residential Landlord–Tenant Act of 1973, chapter 59.18 RCW, to this case. However, the procedures found in the unlawful detainer statutes, chapter 59.12 RCW, apply to the extent they are not supplanted by those found in the Residential Landlord–Tenant Act.
</p>

<p>
[14] <a id="orgd43436e"></a> ¶ 15 As a general rule, forfeiture or termination of leases is “ ‘not favored and never enforced in equity unless the right thereto is so clear as to permit no denial.’ ” Shoemaker v. Shaug, 5 Wash.App. 700, 704, 490 P.2d 439 (1971) (quoting John R. Hansen, Inc. v. Pac. Int’l Corp., 76 Wash.2d 220, 228, 455 P.2d 946 (1969)). At any time during an unlawful detainer proceeding the landlord may apply to the court for a pendente lite writ of restitution. RCW 59.18.370. {{*391}} In order to obtain such a writ of restitution the landlord must apply to the court for an order directing the tenant to appear and show cause why a writ should not issue restoring the landlord to possession of the property. Id. At the time of the show cause hearing “[t]he court shall examine the parties and witnesses orally to ascertain the merits of the complaint and answer.” RCW 59.18.380 (emphasis added). “[I]f it shall appear that the [landlord] has the right to be restored to possession of the property, the court shall enter an order directing the issuance of a writ of restitution.” Id. “The court shall also enter an order directing the parties to proceed to trial on the complaint and answer in the usual manner.” Id. (emphasis added). The court may also at that time {{**427}} address other relief requested by the landlord together with the tenant’s defenses and set-off claims as relates to that relief. Id.
</p>

<p>
¶ 16 Here, neither party provided the transcript from the show cause hearing at which the writ of restitution issued. Ms. Pleasant contends that the judge did not conduct an evidentiary hearing as contemplated by the statute. The Housing Authority claims that the documentary evidence provided by Ms. Pleasant was a sufficient basis for the issuance of the writ of restitution. Nonetheless, the Housing Authority concedes that the judge did not hear testimony or examine the parties or witnesses; rather, it based the issuance of the writ on argument.
</p>

<p>
¶ 17 The statute uses the mandatory term “shall,” which requires that the parties and any witnesses be examined. RCW 59.18.380. Its use of the word “shall” is presumptively imperative and operates to create a mandatory duty. See State v. Marking, 100 Wash.App. 506, 510, 997 P.2d 461 (2000). The examination of parties and witnesses is not a formality as the Housing Authority asserts. It is the basis for the issuance of the writ pendente lite. Further, the statute uses the term “shall” in directing that the matter be set for trial. RCW 59.18.380.
</p>

<p>
{{*392}} ¶ 18 The Housing Authority asserts2 that since there is no report of proceedings we must assume the evidence sustained the court’s findings. That rule limits review to a determination of whether the findings support the judgment. Chace v. Kelsall, 7<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> Wash.2d 984, 987, 435 P.2d 643 (1967). Because the court made no findings, the rule does not apply.
</p>


<p>
ISSUANCE OF WRIT
</p>

<p>
[15] <a id="org8013652"></a> [16] <a id="orgbc19469"></a> [17] <a id="org5fcf9b8"></a> [18] <a id="org27c90dd"></a> [19] <a id="org1edae1a"></a> ¶ 19 The burden is upon the plaintiff in an unlawful detainer action to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the right to possession. Duprey v. Donahoe, 52 Wash.2d 129, 135, 323 P.2d 903 (1958). A show cause hearing in an unlawful detainer action is a summary proceeding. Carlstrom v. Hanline, 98 Wash.App. 780, 788, 990 P.2d 986 (2000). In summary proceedings, the rules of evidence still apply; inadmissible evidence may not be considered. Unger v. Cauchon, 118 Wash.App. 165, 177 n. 34, 73 P.3d 1005 (2003) (citing Dunlap v. Wayne, 105 Wash.2d 529, 535, 716 P.2d 842 (1986)). At oral argument, the Housing Authority argued that because Ms. Pleasant admitted to criminal conduct in her affidavit, it needed no more proof. However, because there is no competent evidence regarding a lease at all, the Housing Authority cannot prove a violation under one. Further, a writ of restitution cannot issue without competent evidence to prove substantial compliance with the statutory notice requirements. Marsh–McLennan Bldg., Inc. v. Clapp, 96 Wash.App. 636, 641–42, 980 P.2d 311 (1999). For instance, proof of service of the notice under the unlawful detainer statutes requires an affidavit. Id. at 640–41, 980 P.2d 311 (citing RCW 59.12.040 and CR 4(g)). There is no affidavit here.
</p>

<p>
[20] <a id="orgae71f1f"></a> ¶ 20 Moreover, if the pleadings in an unlawful detainer action disclose a material issue of fact, the issue must be resolved at trial. RCW 59.12.130; Meadow Park {{*393}} Garden Assocs. v. Canley, 54 Wash.App. 371, 372, 773 P.2d 875 (1989). Specifically, when a tenant challenges her landlord’s allegations that she was in material noncompliance with her lease terms, she is entitled to a trial. Meadow Park, 54 Wash.App. at 372, 773 P.2d 875. That is precisely the contention made by Ms. Pleasant.
</p>

<p>
¶ 21 Ms. Pleasant contends the lease and its termination are subject to the U.S. Housing Act. The Housing Authority’s own materials cite to the U.S. Housing Act and point out that Ms. Pleasant is subject to its provisions. The U.S. Housing Act requires that the tenancies be terminated only for “serious or repeated violation of the terms or conditions of the lease or for other good cause” and that termination for “criminal activity” threaten the “health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants.” 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(l )(5), (6). The issue of whether these requirements are met {{**428}} under the statute was an inappropriate issue to summarily resolve. See Hartson P’ship v. Goodwin, 99 Wash.App. 227, 237, 991 P.2d 1211 (2000). Ms. Pleasant was entitled to a trial on this issue.
</p>

<p>
¶ 22 The writ was premature. We need not address the merits of the forfeiture or the defenses that should be addressed at trial on remand. See id.
</p>

<p>
TRIAL REQUIRED
</p>

<p>
¶ 23 Whether or not the court issues a pendente lite writ at the show cause hearing, the court is required to enter an order directing the matter to proceed to trial. RCW 59.18.380. See also RCW 59.12.130 (providing that all factual issues in unlawful detainer actions must be determined by a jury unless one is waived). RCW 59.18.410 also requires the entry of a final judgment following trial. The court did not set a trial in this case, nor was a final judgment entered.
</p>

<p>
[21] <a id="org16adaa1"></a> [22] <a id="org9840844"></a> ¶ 24 The Housing Authority asserts that no trial was required because the show cause hearing is the only summary proceeding required under the statute. It relies {{*394}} on Carlstrom, 98 Wash.App. 780, 990 P.2d 986. In Carlstrom, Division One of this court observed, “Show cause hearings are summary proceedings to determine the issue of possession pending a lawsuit.” Id. at 788, 990 P.2d 986 (emphasis added) (citing Meadow Park, 54 Wash.App. at 375, 773 P.2d 875). The statute allows a landlord to apply for a writ to expeditiously determine who should possess the property while an unlawful detainer action is pending. Meadow Park, 54 Wash.App. at 376, 773 P.2d 875. In fact, since a pendente lite writ issues on summary proceedings, the landlord is typically required to post a bond<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> to take possession. RCW 59.18.380. That is because “[a] show cause hearing is not the final determination of the rights of the parties in an unlawful detainer action.” Carlstrom, 98 Wash.App. at 788, 990 P.2d 986. Carlstrom does not support the Housing Authority’s argument.
</p>


<p>
ATTORNEY FEES
</p>

<p>
[23] <a id="org106a0fd"></a> ¶ 25 Under RAP 18.1, a party may recover reasonable attorney fees and expenses on appeal if applicable law grants the party such right. Ms. Pleasant requested attorney fees under RCW 59.18.410. That statute, however, applies only to fees and costs to a landlord on final judgment. RCW 59.18.290(1)<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> provides for attorney fees when the landlord removes or excludes a tenant without a court order. Gray v. Pierce County Housing Auth., 123 Wash.App. 744, 759–60, 97 P.3d 26 (2004). Here, a writ was issued. The statute does not provide for attorney fees for a wrongfully {{*395}} issued writ. She has provided no clear authority for attorney fees.
</p>


<p>
CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
¶ 26 The pendente lite writ of restitution was issued on incompetent evidence and without examination of the parties and witnesses as required by statute. Ms. Pleasant was wrongfully denied a trial. We therefore reverse and remand for trial. Ms. Pleasant’s request for fees is denied.

Although moot, Division One reached the merits on an exception to mootness: the issue of whether the tenant’s asserted defense of disability discrimination was a cognizable defense was a matter of “continuing and substantial public interest.” Josephinium, 111 Wash.App. at 622, 45 P.3d 627. The court addressed the right to possession in the context of the tenant’s disability discrimination defense. Id . at 624–26, 45 P.3d 627.

Unlawful detainer action. The Superior Court, King County, F. A. Walterskirchen, J., entered judgment in favor of landlord, and tenant appealed. The Supreme Court, Hunter, J., held that in all contracts for renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action, that fact that tenant knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented premises and fact that rent was reduced did not remove tenant from protection of implied warranty of habitability, that testimony relating to housing code violations was admissible, and that evidence of condition of premises was relevant to issue of rent due and owing.

{{**162}} HUNTER, Associate Justice.
</p>

<p>
This is an unlawful detainer action in which the plaintiff (respondent), Ronald D. Foisy, is seeking the possession of his real property, unpaid rent and damages. The defendant (appellant), Richard Kent Wyman, appeals from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
</p>

<p>
In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged in effect: (1) That on December 31, 1970, the defendant took possession of a house which the plaintiff is seeking to recover, pursuant to a 6-month lease requiring $300 to be paid for said term, plus water and other utility charges; (2) that during the term of the lease the defendant paid the sum of $95, leaving $205 still owing for the 6-month period; (3) That the defendant remained upon the premises after the expiration of the lease; (4) That the rental payment after the expiration of the lease was to be $75 per month; (5) That after the defendant refused to pay the accrued rent, the plaintiff served a 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate upon the defendant on August 27, 1971; (6) That the defendant failed to pay any of the amounts owing after the 3-day notice was served upon him.
</p>

<p>
The defendant’s answer raised several affirmative defenses including breach of implied warranty of habitability.
</p>

<p>
During trial the defendant testified that he took possession of the house on March 3, 1971. It appears that the {{*24}} parties executed the lease in question on March 8, 1971, although the lease was dated December 31, 1970, and was to cover a term of six months, which was to commence on January 1, 1971, and end on June 30, 1971.
</p>

<p>
The lease in question also contained an option to purchase. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he thought he was purchasing the house rather than renting it. His testimony also indicates that the house contained a number of defects when he entered into the lease and it indicates that he was aware of some of the defects when he agreed to rent the house, but not all of them.
</p>

<p>
The trial court concluded that the defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. However, it refused to enforce the provisions of what it termed the ‘purported lease.’ It found that the reasonable rental for the period of occupancy of the premises was the sum of $50 per month commencing with March 3, 1971, until such time as the defendant removed himself. In effect, the court held the lease was invalid. The court also held that a writ of restitution should issue to the sheriff to require the surrender of possession if the defendant did not voluntarily withdraw and that damages for the period March 3, 1971, through April 3, 1972, were to be doubled if the defendant did not surrender the premises by April 3, 1972. The defendant appeals, although the plaintiff does not cross-appeal from the court’s findings.
</p>

<p>
[1] <a id="org2fe7875"></a> The primary contention raised by the defendant is that the trial court erred in refusing to accept evidence as to his affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability. The defendant argues that the plaintiff’s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a failure of consideration upon the part of the plaintiff and relieves the defendant of his obligation to pay rent. We agree that the tenant should have been permitted to introduce evidence at trial in support of this theory of defense.
</p>

<p>
The premises in question, according to the testimony of the defendant, contained a number of defects including a lack of heat, no hot water tank, broken windows, a broken {{*25}} door, water running through the bedroom, an improperly seated and leaking toilet, a leaking sink in the bathroom, broken water pipes in the yard and termites in the basement. No objection was made to the introduction of this testimony. The testimony of the defendant also indicates that he painted the interior and made repairs upon the premises, but ceased making repairs when he learned of a municipal court action being initiated against the plaintiff as a result of numerous housing {{**163}} code violations within the house. In addition, the record reveals that the landlord was informed of the defects and was prosecuted successfully for violations of the Seattle housing code.
</p>

<p>
During the trial the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of two housing inspectors as to the housing code violations which existed on the premises. The trial court sustained the plaintiff’s objections to this testimony upon the theory that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue before the court. We disagree with the reasoning of the trial court in refusing to accept the evidence as to the condition of the premises, although it should be stated that this issue has not been heretofore specifically addressed in this jurisdiction in relation to our unlawful detainer statutes.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the United States, the old rule of caveat emptor in the leasing of premises has been undergoing judicial scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
In Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis.2d 590, 596, 111 N.W.2d 409, 412 (1961), the court stated:
</p>

<p>
To follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. The need and social desirability of adequate housing for people in this era of rapid population increases is too important to be rebuffed by that obnoxious legal cliche , Caveat emptor. Permitting landlords to rent ‘tumbledown’ houses is at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for conscientious landowners.
</p>

Little, 50 Ill.2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).
</p>

<p>
In Lemle v. Breeden, Supra, the court reviewed the rule of caveat emptor and the current trend toward finding an implied warranty of habitability in leases, and stated on page 433, 462 P.2d 474:
</p>

<p>
The application of an implied warranty of habitability in leases gives recognition to the changes in leasing transactions today. It affirms the fact that a lease, is, in essence, a sale as well as a transfer of an estate in land and is, more importantly, a contractual relationship. From that contractual relationship an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the purposes intended is a just and necessary implication. It is a doctrine which has its counterparts in the law of sales and torts and one which when candidly countenanced is impelled by the nature of the transaction and contemporary housing realities. Legal fictions and artificial exceptions to wooden rules of property law aside, we hold that in the lease of a dwelling house, such as in this case, there is an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the use intended.
</p>

<p>
(Footnote omitted.)
</p>

<p>
In Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., Supra, the court analyzed the various exceptions to the common law rule that the lessor has no duty to repair and stated on page 1078:
</p>

<p>
These as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law’s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.
</p>

<p>
It is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. {{*27}} Today’s {{**164}} urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in ‘a house suitable for occupation.’ Furthermore, today’s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the ‘jack-of-all-trades’ farmer who was the common law’s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant’s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today’s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.
</p>

<p>
We find the reasoning of these cases extremely persuasive. Any realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant’s promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord’s promise to provide a livable dwelling. As Judge Skelly Wright stated in the Javins case on page 1074:
</p>

<p>
When American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek ‘shelter’ today, they seek a well known package of goods and services—a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.
</p>

<p>
(Footnote omitted.) Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., 138 U.S.App.D.C. 369, 428 F.2d 1071 (1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 186, 27 L.Ed.2d 185 (1970). The value of the lease today then, whether it is oral or written, is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards.
</p>

<p>
[2] <a id="org1fb64dd"></a> In House v. Thornton, 76 Wash.2d 428, 457 P.2d 199 (1969), {{*28}} we rejected the doctrine of caveat emptor as it applied to the sale of a new residence and found an implied warranty that the structure is fit for the buyer’s intended purpose. In doing so, we noted that the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the sale of a brand-new house by a vendor-builder to a first buyer for the purposes of occupancy. By analogy, the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the renting of premises in our society. There can be little justification for following a rule that was developed for an agrarian society and has failed to keep pace with modern day realities. We therefore hold that in all contracts for the renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. See Javins v. First Nat’l Realty Corp., Supra; Lund v. MacArthur, 51 Haw. 473, 462 P.2d 482 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970), and Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill.2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).
</p>

<p>
[3] <a id="org416c1aa"></a> It can be argued, however, that the defendant should not be entitled to the protection of an implied warranty of habitability since he knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented the premises and the rent was reduced from $87 per month to $50 per month. We believe this type of bargaining by the landlord with the tenant is contrary to public policy and the purpose of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability. A disadvantaged tenant should not be placed in a position of agreeing to live in an uninhabitable premises. Housing conditions, such as the record indicates exist in the instant case, are a health hazard, not only to the individual tenant, but to the community which is exposed to said individual. As the court recognized in Pines v. Perssion, Supra, such housing conditions are at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, {{**165}} juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for the conscientious landowners.
</p>

<p>
Our belief that public policy demands such a result is reinforced by our review of Laws of 1973, 1st Ex.Sess., ch. 207, which became effective July 16, 1973. The legislature {{*29}} in passing this bill and the Governor in signing it have recognized that public policy demands this result. Laws of 1973, 1st Ex.Sess., ch. 207, provides in part:
</p>

<p>
Sec. 6. The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keeps the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:
</p>

<p>
(1) Maintain the premises to substantially comply with any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or regulation governing their maintenance or operation, which the legislative body enacting the applicable code, statute, ordinance or regulation could enforce as to the premises rented;
</p>

<p>
(2) Maintain the roofs, floors, walls, chimneys, fireplaces, foundations, and all other structural components in reasonably good repair so as to be usable and capable of resisting any and all normal forces and loads to which they may be subjected;
</p>

<p>
(5) Except where the condition is attributable to normal wear and tear, make repairs and arrangements necessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy;
</p>

<p>
(7) Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances supplied by him in reasonably good working order;
</p>

<p>
(8) Maintain the dwelling unit in reasonably weathertight condition;
</p>

<p>
(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant;
</p>

<p>
Sec. 8. The tenant shall be current in the payment of rent before exercising any of the remedies accorded him under the provisions of this chapter: Provided, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant’s civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages: Provided further, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant’s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding {{*30}} to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.
</p>

<p>
Sec. 10. . . .
</p>

<p>
(6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs himself in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement thereof to be agreed upon between the parties, and such agreement does not alter the landlord’s obligations under this chapter.
</p>

<p>
It may also be argued that the defendant should not be afforded the protection of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability since the defendant signed a lease which contained an option to purchase. However, as heretofore stated, the trial court failed to recognize the validity of the lease. There is no cross-appeal from this determination and we are therefore bound by the trial court’s decision.
</p>

<p>
The plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct in disregarding the Seattle housing code as it was improperly pleaded and no properly authenticated copy of the housing code was offered. These issues were not before the court when it rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors. It was not until after the court had rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors on the basis of their testimony being irrelevant that the housing code was offered into evidence. Had the court rejected the housing code on the grounds suggested by {{**166}} the plaintiff, the defendant would have been in a position to move to amend his pleadings. The argument as to the housing code not being properly authenticated, we believe, is without merit in view of RCW 5.44.080 which states:
</p>

<p>
When the ordinances of any city or town are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.
</p>

<p>
[4] <a id="org45eebee"></a> The copy of the housing code that was offered into evidence by the defendant is printed by authority of the city {{*31}} of Seattle and is therefore prima facie evidence that the ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.
</p>

<p>
[5] <a id="org2531caa"></a> [6] <a id="org3808f56"></a> [7] <a id="org591b43c"></a> The testimony relating to the housing code violations should have been admitted into evidence, and the trial court erred in ruling that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue of rent due and owing. While the housing code violations in and of themselves do not establish a prima facie case that the premises are uninhabitable, they are evidence which aids in establishing that the premises are uninhabitable.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
[8] <a id="org90aa883"></a> The plaintiff argues, in effect, however, that the unlawful detainer statutes are not designed for defenses such as breach of implied warranty of habitability due to the nature of the action. In light of our previous discussion, we believe this to be without merit.
</p>

<p>
One of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action of this nature is whether or not there is any rent due. RCW 59.12.170, which governs the entry of judgment and execution in an unlawful detainer action, states that upon a finding of default in the payment of rent, ‘the judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of the lease, agreement or tenancy.’ RCW 59.12.030 provides:
</p>

<p>
A tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either:
</p>

<p>
(3) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises . . .
</p>

<p>
[9] <a id="orgef2f9ff"></a> Since the affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability goes directly to the issue of rent due {{*32}} and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action as the above statutes indicate, we now hold said defense is available in an unlawful detainer action of this nature. See Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, supra.
</p>

<p>
[10] <a id="org6cbede9"></a> The defendant also contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in the instant case, since the amount demanded in the 3-day notice was more than the trial court found was actually due and owing. We disagree.
</p>

<p>
In Provident Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Thrower, 155 Wash. 613, 617, 285 P. 654, 655 (1930), we stated:
</p>

<p>
As to the form and contents of the notice or demand, a substantial compliance with the statute is sufficient.
</p>

<p>
See Sowers v. Lewis, 49 Wash.2d 891, 307 P.2d 1064 (1957). See also Erz v. Reese, 157 Wash. 32, 288 P. 255 (1930) (wherein we stated on page 35 that ‘we have never adopted the strictest rule of construction as to the form or contents of such notices under our unlawful detainer statutes, chiefly for the reason, doubtless, that the statutes prescribe no form.’) In the Provident Mutual case the notice was defective in three respects: (1) It contained the signature {{**167}} of the agent rather than the owner; (2) it overstated the amount of rent due by $165 as found by the trial court; and (3) it defectively described the premises. Although we did not specifically address the issue of the overstatement of the amount of rent due, we did hold the notice substantially complied with the requirements of Rem.Comp.Stat., s 812 (now RCW 59.12.030).
</p>

<p>
In the instant case, the 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate the premises that was served upon the defendant called for the payment of $205, the balance due under the lease, plus $75 per month for July and August. There was no dispute as to the monthly rental payment under the terms of the purported lease; however, there was a conflict as to the amount of the monthly rental due for the months of July and August. The plaintiff testified the rent for those months was to be $75 per month, and the defendant testified that it {{*33}} was to be $50 per month. It appears that the plaintiff’s demand for rental in the notice was in conformity with his good faith determination as to the amount of rental due, and that the defendant was not prejudiced as he could have tendered to the plaintiff the amount of rental due according to his understanding of the agreement. See C.J. Peck, Landlord and Tenant Notices, 31 Wash.L.Rev. 51, 61 (1956). In tendering the amount due to the plaintiff, of course, he would deduct that amount due which he believed he was relieved from paying due to the landlord’s breach of his implied warranty of habitability.
</p>

<p>
We believe that under the above facts, the plaintiff’s demand for rental was in substantial compliance with the statute and the fact that there was a dispute as to the amount of rent due, which was later determined contrary to the plaintiff, should not invalidate the unlawful detainer proceeding.
</p>

<p>
The defendant also contends that the portion of RCW 59.12.170, which authorizes the doubling of damages, is unconstitutional as it is in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.
</p>

<p>
We need not reach this issue in light of the passage of the ‘Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973’ (Laws of 1973, 1st Ex.Sess., ch. 207), which eliminated the mandatory double damage provision from the law.
</p>

<p>
[11] Where substantial legislative or decisional changes in the applicable statutory provisions have been made thereby precluding the imposition of the challenged provision, the constitutional issue need not be resolved. Grays Harbor Paper Co. v. Grays Harbor County, 74 Wash.2d 70, 442 P.2d 967 (1968); State School Directors Ass’n v. Department of Labor &amp; Indus., 82 Wash.2d 367, 510 P.2d 818 (1973). See also State v. Vidal, 82 Wash.2d 74, 508 P.2d 158 (1973), and State v. Baker, 81 Wash.2d 281, 501 P.2d 284 (1972).
</p>

<p>
As we stated in Sorenson v. Bellingham, 80 Wash.2d 547, 558, 496 P.2d 512, 518 (1972):
</p>

<p>
It is a general rule that, where only moot questions or {{*34}} abstract propositions are involved, or where the substantial questions involved in the trial court no longer exist, the appeal, or writ of error, should be dismissed. There is an exception to the above stated proposition. The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, retain and decide an appeal which has otherwise become moot when it can be said that matters of continuing and substantial public interest are involved. . . . This exception to the general rule obtains only where the real merits of the controversy are unsettled and a continuing question of great public importance exists.
</p>

<p>
(Citations omitted.)
</p>

<p>
Given the passage of the new landlord-tenant act and the absence of any actual trial court imposition of double damages in the instant case, the exception to the above rule is not in force and we therefore need not comment further upon this issue.
</p>

<p>
For the guidance of the trial court at the new trial to which the defendant is entitled, {{**168}} the finder of fact must make two findings where the defendant claims the landlord has breached his implied warranty of habitability: (1) Whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant’s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord’s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability. If the finder of fact determines that the entire rental obligation is extinguished by the landlord’s total breach, then the action for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent must fail. If, on the other hand, the court determines that the premises are partially habitable, and the tenant failed to tender to the plaintiff a sufficient amount to pay rent due for the partially habitable premises, then judgment shall be entered in accordance with RCW 59.12.170.
</p>

<p>
The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.
</p>

<p>
HALE, C.J., and ROSELLINI, HAMILTON, STAFFORD and UTTER, JJ., concur.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb2bd9a1">
<p>
Ignoring the defendant’s own testimony, the majority cast this dispute into a traditional landlord-tenant battle and from that relationship creates an implied warranty of habitability. That creation might well be a desirable change in Washington law, but this simply is not the case in which it should be implemented.
</p>

<p>
The majority’s application of such a warranty to the defects presented in this case and even its characterization of the defendant as a mere ‘tenant’ are unsound in light of the defendant’s testimony, elicited by his own counsel:
</p>

<p>
Q. And what was the agreement between you and the Foiseys relating to the purchase of that house? A. The agreement was that I was to pay $50 a month to buy the house . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that the agreement was that you were to buy the house for $50 a month? A. That was my understanding . . . Q. At the time you moved in, were there defects on the premises? A. All kinds but I tried my best to bring them up to some remedy of standard . . . Q. What was your understanding as to what you had to do to exercise the option? A. My understanding was to clean the house up and fix it up to some degree. Q. So, in other words, you thought that—A. Take care of it like a regular home owner. I figure it was mine and I was going to try to do the best I could but I run into all kinds of difficulty with the permit . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that you were purchasing the house and that is your only obligation to pay $50 a month? A. That was the whole understanding at the conception of the deal because her mother told me (objection). Q. So, the only time prior to March you were on the premises was to just look at it? A. Right. I told them I would buy and they said fine. They put me in it for $50 a month. Q. Had you done any work cleaning up the house or anything around the premises before you moved in on March? A. Oh, yes, I had to. Q. Before you moved in? A. Right, I had to. In the basement there was termites and there was things. Q. When were you doing those things? A. In February . . . Q. At that time did you have any agreement with the Foiseys as to whether or not you were going to purchase it? A. I had the agreement before I walked in {{*36}} that house. That’s when they told me you can have it for $50 a month. They wanted $87 a month. I said it isn’t worth it because it’s sitting still and the windows are out. (Interruption). Q. That understanding was that you were going to pay $50 per month? A. Correct. That is the only way I would walk in that house because I wasn’t in the proper position to bargain. They bargained to me because I {{**169}} saw a deal and I grabbed it . . . Q. As far as you were concerned, you never received any word that you were anything but a purchaser, is that right? A. To my knowledge, that was the only way I would have gone into that house as a purchaser. What would I want to rent it for I had a house of my own.
</p>

<p>
From that testimony it is perfectly clear that the defendant was fully aware of the defects and deficiencies in the premises. Those defects and deficiencies were the very reason he was willing and able to negotiate lower payments.
</p>

<p>
It requires no authority to sustain the proposition that a person who takes possession of premises with known defects, intends to repair those defects, bargains for reduced monthly payments and characterizes the transaction as a ‘deal’ which he ‘grabbed,’ neither deserves nor needs the protection of an implied warranty of habitability.
</p>

<p>
The fact of the matter, apparent from the record, is that the defendant encountered difficulties with his continued, anticipated repairs when the housing code violations pending against the plaintiffs came to light. That situation might give rise to other remedies, but they are not asserted here.
</p>

<p>
But apart from the foregoing, and even if the defendant is to be characterized as a tenant in the strict legal sense of that word, the majority fails to recognized that the Seattle housing code was not properly before the trial court.
</p>

<p>
In his answer, affirmative defense and counterclaim, the defendant alleged violations of the provisions of the housing, building, fire, health and sanitation codes of the city of Seattle. Such shotgun pleading is a clear violation of CR 9(i). At the time of trial, absolutely no proof of the housing code was provided, except to offer an unauthenticated, unidentified booklet entitled ‘Housing Code, City of Seattle.’ {{*37}} The trial court, on that ground alone, correctly rejected testimony about violations of a city ordinance which had not been properly pleaded, properly authenticated or properly identified.
</p>

<p>
The trial court should be affirmed.
</p>

<p>
WRIGHT, J., concurs in the dissent.
</p>

<p>
RYAN, Judge pro tem. (concurring in the result of the dissent).
</p>

<p>
However desirable the majority’ endorsement of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability may be, this is not a proper case for its application.
</p>

<p>
I would, therefore, concur in the result of the dissent.

Evidence of one or two minor infractions of a housing code which do not affect habitability are inconsequential and would not entitle the tenant to a reduction in rent.
