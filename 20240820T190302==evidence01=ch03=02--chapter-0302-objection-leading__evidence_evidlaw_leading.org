* 3.02: Objection, Leading
Leading questions are prohibited on direct examination, except for those questions that are preliminary, transitional, about non-controversial metters, or asked of an uncooperative witness or a witness designated in Rule 611(c).

A question is leading when its words or its context suggest the answer to the witness.
