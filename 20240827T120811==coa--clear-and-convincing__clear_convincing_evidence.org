* Vukich v. Anderson, 97 Wn. App. 684, 690, 985 P.2d 952, 955–56 (1999)
Significantly, Mr. Anderson's evidence in the form of the lease,
tenant's statement, California bank account, California home purchase,
is not refuted. Mr. Anderson's **956 statements are internally
consistent and directly refute Mr. Vukich's evidence. In other words
it is _clear and convincing_.
