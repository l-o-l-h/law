* Is a Summons Considered a Pleading in Washington Law?

** Summary

No,  a  summons   is  not  considered  a   pleading  under  Washington
law. Washington Superior Court Civil  Rule 7(a) provides an exhaustive
definition of pleadings that does  not include summons, and Washington
case law explicitly confirms that a summons is classified as "process"
rather  than a  pleading.  The  Washington Court  of Appeals  directly
stated in 2019  that "A summons is not a  pleading" and explained that
summons falls under  Civil Rule 4 governing  "Process" while pleadings
are   governed   by  Civil   Rule   7   _Chengdu  Gaishi   Electronics,
Ltd. v. G.A.E.M.S., Inc._, 11 Wash.App.2d 617 (2019).

** Definition of Pleadings Under Washington Civil Rule 7(a)

Washington Superior  Court Civil  Rule 7(a) establishes  a restrictive
and exhaustive  definition of  what constitutes  a pleading.  The rule
provides  an   enumerated  list   of  allowable   pleadings  including
complaints,   answers,   replies    to   counterclaims,   answers   to
cross-claims,   third-party  complaints,   third-party  answers,   and
court-ordered  replies. The  rule  further establishes  that no  other
pleadings  shall  be  allowed beyond  those  specifically  identified,
creating a  closed-category approach that means  only the specifically
enumerated  documents  qualify  as pleadings  under  Washington  civil
procedure.

This  exhaustive   list  approach   establishes  that   documents  not
specifically  identified  cannot  be  classified  as  pleadings  under
Washington civil procedure rules.

** Classification of Summons as Process

Washington  courts   have  consistently  distinguished   summons  from
pleadings by classifying  summons as "process" under Civil  Rule 4. In
_Chengdu Gaishi  Electronics, Ltd. v. G.A.E.M.S.,  Inc._, the Washington
Court of Appeals explained that "Process"  is defined as a "summons or
writ, esp[ecially] to  appear or respond in court" and  noted that "CR
4, entitled  "Process," discusses the  requirements for a  summons. By
contrast,  "pleadings"   are  defined   in  rule  7"   _Chengdu  Gaishi
Electronics, Ltd. v. G.A.E.M.S., Inc._,  11 Wash.App.2d 617 (2019). The
court then  explicitly stated: "A  summons is not a  pleading" _Chengdu
Gaishi  Electronics, Ltd.   v.  G.A.E.M.S.,  Inc._, 11  Wash.App.2d 617
(2019).

This  distinction  reflects  the   different  functional  roles  these
documents  serve  in  civil   litigation,  with  pleadings  containing
substantive  allegations  and  defenses while  summons  serves  notice
functions.

** Historical and Consistent Judicial Treatment

The classification of summons as process rather than pleading has deep
roots in  Washington jurisprudence. As  early as 1943,  the Washington
Supreme Court  in _Roth  v. Nash_ adopted  reasoning from  the Minnesota
Supreme Court characterizing  summons as "not a process,  but merely a
notice  given  by  the  plaintiff's attorney  to  the  defendant  that
proceedings have  been instituted, and  that judgment therein  will be
taken against him if he fails to  answer" _Roth v. Nash_, 19 Wash.2d 731
(1943). This precedent established  the fundamental understanding that
summons functions as a notice  mechanism distinct from the substantive
pleadings that contain the actual claims and defenses.

More  recent decisions  continue to  reinforce this  distinction.  The
Washington Court  of Appeals  in _Beckman ex  rel.  Beckman  v.  State,
Department of Social & Health Services_ emphasized that Civil Rule 7(a)
"defines 'pleadings,' and that  definition does not include judgments"
and  noted that  "the  civil rules  treat  judgments differently  than
pleadings" _Beckman ex  rel.  Beckman v.  State, Dept.   of Social and
Health  Services_,  102  Wash.App.    687  (2000).   While  this  case
specifically addressed judgments rather  than summons, it demonstrates
the courts'  consistent approach of  strictly applying the  Civil Rule
7(a) definition to exclude documents not specifically enumerated.

** Procedural Implications of the Distinction

The  classification of  summons as  process rather  than pleading  has
significant   procedural    consequences   under    Washington   civil
procedure. Different amendment rules apply to each category: pleadings
are amended under  Civil Rule 15, while summons and  other process are
amended under  Civil Rule  4(h) _Mandawala  v. Era  Living at  ATP_, Not
Reported in Pac.  Rptr. (2020). The  2020 decision in _Mandawala v. Era
Living at  ATP_ specifically  addressed this distinction,  holding that
"CR 15 applies to the amendment of a pleading, not a summons. It is CR
4(h) that  applies to the  amendment of  a summons" _Mandawala  v. Era
Living at ATP_, Not Reported in Pac. Rptr. (2020).

Additionally,  the   distinction  affects  how  challenges   to  these
documents are raised. Defects in summons are addressed through motions
under Civil  Rule 12(b)(4)  for insufficient  process or  12(b)(5) for
insufficient service  of process, while challenges  to the substantive
adequacy of pleadings are typically  brought under Civil Rule 12(b)(6)
for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted _Chengdu
Gaishi  Electronics, Ltd.  v.  G.A.E.M.S.,  Inc._, 11  Wash.App.2d 617
(2019).

** Recent Developments

Recent Washington cases continue to affirm the established distinction
between summons and pleadings without any indication of change in this
fundamental  classification. The  2024  decision in  _Pecelj v.  Sparks_
discussed Civil  Rule 4 governing  "Process" and the  requirement that
"the summons and complaint shall be served together" in the context of
analyzing  service  of  process  requirements  _Pecelj  v.  Sparks_,  32
Wash.App.2d 404 (2024). The  2020 _Mandawala_ decision further clarified
the  separate treatment  of  summons and  pleadings  in the  amendment
context, confirming  that different  civil rules govern  amendments to
each type of document _Mandawala v.  Era Living at ATP_, Not Reported in
Pac. Rptr. (2020).

** Commentary on This Question

A  summons is  a formal  notice  issued by  the court  that informs  a
defendant   of  the   commencement  of   a  lawsuit   and  compels   a
response. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), a summons
is  distinct  from  a  pleading and  must  contain  specific  elements
including   the   court   and    parties’   names,   the   defendant’s
identification,  the plaintiff’s  attorney information,  the timeframe
for the defendant’s response, and  a warning regarding consequences of
failing  to respond.  A  summons  is issued  by  the  clerk after  the
complaint  is filed  and  must be  served  along with  a  copy of  the
complaint  on  the defendant.  It  is  not  itself  a pleading  but  a
procedural device for providing notice  of the suit and initiating the
defendant's obligation to respond.
- OCNR-FEDRCIVTR APP I :: Appendix I Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

Washington  practice   treats  adversary  proceedings   in  bankruptcy
similarly to  ordinary civil  cases, where  a complaint  commences the
proceeding accompanied  by a  summons. The  summons and  complaint are
served on necessary  parties, with service regulations  spelled out by
the  relevant bankruptcy  rules. These  procedural steps  position the
summons as  a notice device  rather than a pleading,  since responsive
pleadings address the claims in  the complaint rather than the summons
itself.
- 28  WAPRAC § 9.21 :: §9.21 Adversary Proceedings or Contested Matters

Pleadings generally consist  of complaints,
answers, and other responsive documents, not the summons.
