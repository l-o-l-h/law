him was void was inadmissible.

River Stone Holdings NW, LLC v. Lopez, Court of Appeals of Washington, Division 2. April 25, 2017 | 199 Wash.App. 87 | 395 P.3d 1071

Forcible Entry and Detainer | Display Key Number Topics 179k12 Defenses

Former homeowner's arguments that the promissory note was not properly
assigned,  that the  appointment of  a successor  trustee was  legally
ineffective,  and that  the  foreclosure and  trustee's  sale did  not
comply with the  Deeds of Trust Act (DTA) were  not available defenses
to  unlawful-detainer   action  against  former  homeowner   filed  by
purchaser of  home at  the trustee's  sale, and  thus the  trial court
could  not consider  them;  an  unlawful-detainer defendant  generally
could not raise defective title as a defense to possession, and former
homeowner either did not attempt to restrain the trustee's sale or was
unsuccessful at doing so. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 61.24.130(1).

An unlawful-detainer defendant generally  cannot raise defective title
as a defense to possession.
