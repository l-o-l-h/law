* RLTA

[[denote:20250527T124941][RCW 59.18.257(1)(c)]] requires the landlord to provide a written notice of the adverse action.

* FCRA

Also, if the denial was based on information the landlord obtained from a consumer report, then Washington's FCRA, specifically RCW 19.182.110, also requires written notice of the reasons for the denial/adverse action.
