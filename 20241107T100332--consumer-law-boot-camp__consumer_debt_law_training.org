** TransUnion Dispute with FTC
On the FTC case against Transunion:

Here is the  summary I have on the case:

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires consumer reporting agencies to
follow “reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy” of
the information in consumer reports, including reports used to screen
prospective tenants. Last year, the FTC and CFPB settled with Trans
Union and its tenant screening subsidiary, alleging the companies
failed to meet that standard. To settle the case, the companies agreed
to significant changes in how they do business.

This is a link to the order I found online:
