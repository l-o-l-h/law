* Voluntary Dismissal of Unlawful Detainer Action Under CR 41(a)(1)(B).

A tenant dispossessed by writ of restitution has a right to a trial on
the issue of possession under both the unlawful detainer statute (RCW
59.12.130) and the Residential Landlordâ€“Tenant Act (RCW 59.18.380 and
.410).
- Munden v. Hazelrigg, 105 Wash.2d 39, 45, 711 P.2d 295 (1985);
- Housing Auth. v. Pleasant, 126 Wash.App. 382, 389, 109 P.3d 422 (2005).


The issue is not moot merely because the tenant no longer has
possession; a displaced tenant who does not concede the right of
possession is entitled to have that right determined.
