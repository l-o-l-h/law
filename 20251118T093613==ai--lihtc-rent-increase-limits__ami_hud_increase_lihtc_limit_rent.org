* What is the LIHTC rent increase limit in Washington state

** Overview

In  Washington  state, properties  under  the  Low-Income Housing  Tax
Credit (LIHTC) program are generally  exempt from the state's new rent
increase  cap  law (HB  1217)  because  they  are already  subject  to
specific  government  affordable  housing  regulations.  The  relevant
limits for  these properties are  based on federal guidelines  tied to
the  Area Median  Income (AMI),  as  determined by  the Department  of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

** LIHTC Rent Limits

The maximum allowable  rent for a LIHTC unit is  calculated based on a
percentage of  the AMI for the  specific county or area,  typically at
the 50% or 60% AMI level. This rent is generally capped at 30% of that
specific AMI level for the corresponding unit size.

These  limits  are updated  annually  by  the federal  government  and
published  by   the  [[https://wshfc.org/Managers/Map.aspx][Washington   State  Housing   Finance  Commission]]
(WSHFC).  Property  owners  are  responsible for  using  the  correct,
annually updated limits for their specific properties.

** Washington State Rent Cap Law Exemption

The statewide  rent cap law (HB  1217), which went into  effect in May
2025, limits annual rent increases  for most residential properties to
the lesser of 10% or 7%  plus the Consumer Price Index (CPI). However,
this law  specifically exempts  units that  are already  restricted by
government  affordable housing  programs,  which  includes most  LIHTC
developments.

Therefore, LIHTC properties must adhere to their specific program rent
limits rather than the general state rent cap.
