* Moneys paid as deposit or security for performance by tenant—Written rental agreement to specify terms and conditions for retention by landlord—Written checklist required.

1) If any moneys are paid to the landlord by the tenant as a deposit
   or as security for performance of the tenant's obligations in a
   lease or rental agreement, the lease or rental agreement shall be
   in writing and shall include the terms and conditions under which
   the deposit or portion thereof may be withheld by the landlord upon
   termination of the lease or rental agreement. If all or part of the
   deposit may be withheld to indemnify the landlord for damages to
   the premises for which the tenant is responsible, the rental
   agreement shall be in writing and shall so specify.

2) No deposit may be collected by a landlord unless the rental
   agreement is in writing and a written checklist or statement is
   provided by the landlord to the tenant at the commencement of the
   tenancy specifically describing the condition and cleanliness of or
   existing damages to the premises, fixtures, equipment, appliances,
   and furnishings including, but not limited to:

   (a) Walls, including wall paint and wallpaper;

   (b) Carpets and other flooring;

   (c) Furniture; and

   (d) Appliances.

3) The checklist or statement shall be signed and dated by the
   landlord and the tenant, and the tenant shall be provided with a
   copy of the signed checklist or statement. The tenant has the right
   to request one free replacement copy of the written checklist.

4) No such deposit shall be withheld on account of wear resulting from
   ordinary use of the premises.

5) If the landlord collects a deposit without providing a written
   checklist at the commencement of the tenancy, the landlord is
   liable to the tenant for the amount of the deposit, and the
   prevailing party may recover court costs and reasonable attorneys'
   fees. This section does not limit the tenant's right to recover
   moneys paid as damages or security under RCW 59.18.280.
