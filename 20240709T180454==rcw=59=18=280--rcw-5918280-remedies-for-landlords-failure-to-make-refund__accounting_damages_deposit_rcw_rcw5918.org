* Moneys paid as deposit or security for performance by tenant—Statement and notice of basis for retention—Remedies for landlord's failure to make refund—Exception.

1) (a) Within 30 days after the termination of the rental agreement
   and vacation of the premises or, if the tenant abandons the
   premises as defined in RCW 59.18.310, within 30 days after the
   landlord learns of the abandonment, the landlord shall give a full
   and specific statement of the basis for retaining any of the
   deposit, and any documentation required by (b) of this subsection,
   together with the payment of any refund due the tenant under the
   terms and conditions of the rental agreement.

   The landlord complies with this subsection if these are delivered
   to the tenant personally or deposited in the United States mail
   properly addressed to the tenant's last known address with
   first-class postage prepaid within the 30 days.

   (b) With the statement required by (a) of this subsection, the
   landlord shall include copies of estimates received or invoices
   paid to reasonably substantiate damage charges. Where repairs are
   performed by the landlord or the landlord's employee, if a
   deduction is made for materials or supplies, the landlord shall
   provide a copy of the bill, invoice, or receipt. The landlord may
   document the cost of materials or supplies already in the
   landlord's possession or purchased on an ongoing basis by providing
   a copy of a bill, invoice, receipt, vendor price list, or other
   vendor document that reasonably documents the cost of the item used
   in the repair or cleaning of the unit. Where repairs are performed
   by the landlord or the landlord's employee, the landlord shall
   include a statement of the time spent performing repairs and the
   reasonable hourly rate charged.

   (c) No portion of any deposit may be withheld:

       (i) For wear resulting from ordinary use of the premises;

       (ii) For carpet cleaning unless the landlord documents wear to
   the carpet that is beyond wear resulting from ordinary use of the
   premises;

       (iii) For the costs of repair and replacement of fixtures,
   equipment, appliances, and furnishings if their condition was not
   reasonably documented in the written checklist required under RCW
   59.18.260; or

       (iv) In excess of the cost of repair or replacement of the
   damaged portion in situations in which the premises, including
   fixtures, equipment, appliances, and furnishings, are damaged in
   excess of wear resulting from ordinary use of the premises but the
   damage does not encompass the item's entirety.

2) If the landlord fails to give the statement and any documentation
   required by subsection (1) of this section together with any refund
   due the tenant within the time limits specified in subsection (1)
   of this section he or she shall be liable to the tenant for the
   full amount of the deposit.

   The landlord is also barred in any action brought by the tenant to
   recover the deposit from asserting any claim or raising any defense
   for retaining any of the deposit unless the landlord shows that
   circumstances beyond the landlord's control prevented the landlord
   from providing the statement and any documentation within the 30
   days or that the tenant abandoned the premises as defined in RCW
   59.18.310.

   The court may in its discretion award up to two times the amount of
   the deposit for the intentional refusal of the landlord to give the
   statement, documentation, or refund due unless the landlord shows
   that circumstances beyond the landlord's control prevented the
   landlord from providing the statement and any such documentation
   within 30 days or that the tenant abandoned the premises as
   described in RCW 59.18.310.

   In any action brought by the tenant to recover the deposit, the
   prevailing party shall additionally be entitled to the cost of suit
   or arbitration including a reasonable attorneys' fee.

3) (a) Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the landlord from
   proceeding against, and the landlord shall have the right to
   proceed against a tenant to recover sums exceeding the amount of
   the tenant's damage or security deposit for damage to the property
   for which the tenant is responsible together with reasonable
   attorneys' fees.

   However, if the landlord seeks reimbursement for damages from the
   landlord mitigation program pursuant to RCW 43.31.605(1)(d), the
   landlord is prohibited from retaining any portion of the tenant's
   damage or security deposit or proceeding against the tenant who
   terminates under RCW 59.18.575 to recover sums exceeding the amount
   of the tenant's damage or security deposit for damage to the
   property.

   (b) Damages for wear resulting from ordinary use of the premises or
   not substantiated by documentation equivalent to that required in
   subsection (1) of this section may not be charged to the tenant,
   reported to any consumer reporting agency, tenant screening
   service, or prospective landlord, or submitted for collection by
   any third-party agency.

   (c) For tenancies with rental agreements initiated on or after July
   23, 2023, any lawsuit filed against a tenant to recover sums
   exceeding the amount of the deposit shall be commenced within three
   years of the termination of the rental agreement or the tenant's
   abandonment of the premises.

4) The requirements with respect to checklists and documentation that
   are set forth in RCW 59.18.260 and this section do not apply to
   situations in which part or all of a security deposit is withheld
   by the landlord for reasons unrelated to damages to the premises,
   fixtures, equipment, appliances, and furnishings, such as for rent
   or other charges owing.
