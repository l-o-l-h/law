Triune is correct that a party may waive the defense of lack of
jurisdiction by seeking affirmative relief, thereby invoking the
jurisdiction of the court.
- See In re Marriage of Parks, 48 Wash.App. 166, 170, 737 P.2d 1316 (1987).


Affirmative relief is defined as “ ‘[r]elief for which defendant might
maintain an action independently of plaintiff's claim and on which he
might proceed to recovery, although plaintiff abandoned his cause of
action or failed to establish it.’ “ Negash v. Sawyer, 131
Wash.App. 822, 827, 129 P.3d 824 (2006) (quoting Grange Ins. Ass'n
v. State, 110 Wash.2d 752, 765–66, 757 P.2d 933 (1988)).


Ms. Pfeifer did request judgment for her costs and attorney fees, but
presenting defenses and requesting judgment for costs and attorney
fees against the landlord is not a request for affirmative relief.
- See id. at 826–27, 129 P.3d 824.


Ms. Pfeifer did not waive her lack of jurisdiction defense. Dismissal
without prejudice was the proper remedy at the August 12 hearing.
