* Settlement Agreements

** Settlement Agreement Terms
[[https://elrolaw.com/blog/what-terms-should-be-included-in-a-settlement-agreement/][Article on Settlement Agreement Terms]]

1. Amount of Payment or Basic Settlement Terms

   ✔ Clearly states all the consideration being provided and any performance terms related to such consideration
   ✔ Addresses any issues relevant to the payment of any settlement proceeds, such as:
     - The amount
     - Timing
     - Potential tax consequences of settlement payments
     - Whether the recipient will be entitled to receive interest or late charges for any delinquent payments
   ✔ Clearly identifies if there is pending litigation or another proceeding that will be resolved as a result of the settlement and details the action to be taken by the parties with respect to such pending matter (such as dismissal)
   ✔ Addresses the parties’ respective obligations regarding attorney’s fees and costs incurred in entering into the settlement agreement
   ✔ Includes an integration clause stating that the agreement constitutes the parties’ entire agreement and supersedes all prior negotiations/other agreements
   ✔ States that agreement is legally binding on the parties and their successors, assignees, etc.
   ✔ States that the party representatives who sign the agreement are authorized to do so and bind the party
   ✔ Set forth where future cases must be filed, the law that must be applied, and the court that will have the authority to hear the case (consider whether the court should retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement)
   ✔ Includes a non-disparagement provision that prohibits defamatory or disparaging comments against opposing parties and permits the disparaged party to seek redress for disparagement


2. Additional Terms of Settlement

3. Characterization of Payment (Tax)
4. Claims Resolved
5. Release and Waiver of Rights

   Parties to a business dispute will commonly agree to resolve all
   claims, known and unknown, arising or accruing prior to the date of
   settlement. But, this isn’t always the best approach, and parties
   that have concerns about unknown potential liabilities must be
   extremely careful to avoid giving up necessary rights to sue.

   Future claims are not waived.

   ✔ Unless otherwise agreed to, includes language providing for a general release that will cover all actual or potential claims, whether known and unknown, that the releasing parties may have had, may have, or may acquire in the future relating to the subject matter of the settlement
   ✔ States that the released claims will be dismissed with prejudice, if agreed upon
   ✔ Specifies that it is a mutual release, if agreed upon
   ✔ States explicitly which claims are not released if not a comprehensive release
   ✔ Makes the release binding on successors in interest and any relevant third parties

6. Confidentiality and Nondisclosure

   It should be abundantly clear what rights each party is (and isn’t)
   waiving so that there are no ambiguities regarding the parties’
   rights in the future.

7. Default and Enforcement

   These provisions should specify what constitutes a default under
   the agreement (i.e., failure to make a settlement payment when
   due), and they should specify how the non-defaulting party is
   entitled to enforce performance (i.e., through a confession of
   judgment). A settlement agreement may include provisions regarding
   jurisdiction, venue and attorneys’ fees to help facilitate
   enforcement as well.

   - Date of Execution
   - Governing Law

8. Remedies

   many settlement agreements will include a provision for liquidated
   damages. This type of provision states the specific amount that the
   plaintiff is entitled to recover when enforcing the defendant’s
   settlement liability.

   - Enforceability
   - Dispute Resolution methods

9. Force Majeure
10. Binding Effect

    In many cases, this will include not only the specific parties to
    the dispute at issue but also their respective subsidiaries,
    affiliates, owners and other related parties.

    ✔ All parties to the lawsuit
    ✔ Affiliates
    ✔ Subsidiaries
    ✔ Parent or holding companies
    ✔ Exclusive licensees and non-exclusive licensees
    ✔ Franchisors and franchisees


Some other terms

1. Recitals
2. Identifying information for all involved parties.
3. A description of the issue you’re seeking to settle.
4. Legal purpose

   The legal purpose of a settlement agreement expresses the intent
   and reason for the agreement between all involved parties.3. An offer of resolutions that both parties agree to.

5. An Offer

   To be legally binding, the settlement agreement must propose a
   possible resolution to the dispute.

6. Proof of valid consideration from both parties without coercion or duress

7. Acceptance of the Terms (Mutual Assent)

8. Waiver of Unknown Claims

9. No Admission of Liability

   ✔ Was entered into solely for the purpose of allowing the parties
   to avoid further litigation

   ✔ Does not constitute an admission by either party of any
   wrongdoing, contractual obligation, or any duty whatsoever
