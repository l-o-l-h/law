Notice—--Alternative procedure—--Court's jurisdiction limited—--Application to chapter 59.20 RCW

1. When the  landlord, after the exercise of due  diligence, is unable
   to personally serve the summons on the tenant, the landlord may use
   the alternative means of service as follows:

   - (a) The  summons and complaint  shall be posted in  a conspicuous
     place on  the premises unlawfully  held, not less than  nine days
     from the return date stated in the summons; and

   - (b) Copies of the summons and complaint shall be deposited in the
     mail, postage  prepaid, by both  regular mail and  certified mail
     directed to the tenant's or  tenants' last known address not less
     than nine days from the return date stated in the summons.

2.  When service  on the  tenant or  tenants is  accomplished by  this
   alternative  procedure,  the  court's jurisdiction  is  limited  to
   restoring possession of  the premises to the landlord  and no money
   judgment may  be entered against  the tenant or tenants  until such
   time as jurisdiction over the tenant or tenants is obtained.

3.  Before  the  entry of  any  judgment  or  issuance  of a  writ  of
   restitution due  to the  tenant's failure  to appear,  the landlord
   shall  provide the  court with  a  declaration from  the person  or
   persons who served the tenant  that describes the service achieved,
   and  if  by alternative  service  pursuant  to this  section,  that
   describes  the  efforts  at  personal  service  before  alternative
   service was used and a declaration from the landlord stating his or
   her belief that the tenant cannot be found.

4. For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the exercise of
   due diligence is  met if the landlord attempts  personal service on
   the tenant at least three times over  not less than two days and at
   different times of the day.

5. This section shall apply to this chapter and chapter 59.20 RCW.
