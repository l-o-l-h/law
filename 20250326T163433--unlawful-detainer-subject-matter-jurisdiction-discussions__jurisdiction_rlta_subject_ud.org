¶ 15 Division Two, on the other hand, recognizes that the state constitution vests the superior court with subject matter jurisdiction in unlawful detainer actions, and its jurisdiction remains constant regardless of procedural missteps *374 by the parties. Tacoma Rescue Mission v. Stewart, 155 Wash.App. 250, 254 n. 9, 228 P.3d 1289 (2010). In Tacoma Rescue Mission, the tenant was served with a termination notice that failed to provide details required by the lease. The trial court denied a motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for dismissal of the action—not because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, but because the notice was insufficient to permit the action to be maintained. The court explained why it was inaccurate to characterize the issue as a lack of subject matter jurisdiction:
Some cases speak of the trial court lacking jurisdiction to hear unlawful detainer actions, chapter 59.12 RCW, without adequate notice to the tenant. See, e.g., Christensen v. Ellsworth, 162 Wash.2d 365, 372, 173 P.3d 228 (2007); Hous. Auth. v. Terry, 114 Wash.2d 558, 566, 789 P.2d 745 (1990); IBF, LLC v. Heuft, 141 Wash.App. 624, 632, 174 P.3d 95 (2007); Hous. Auth. v. Silva, 94 Wash.App. 731, 734, 972 P.2d 952 (1999). But under chapter 59.12 RCW, “[t]he superior court of the county in which the property or some part of it is situated shall have jurisdiction of proceedings **904 under this chapter.” RCW 59.12.050. Furthermore, superior courts have broad general jurisdiction over real estate disputes. See WASH. CONST. art. IV, § 6; Young v. Clark, 149 Wash.2d 130, 133–34, 65 P.3d 1192 (2003). Thus, a superior court has jurisdiction to determine whether an unlawful detainer action may go forward. See RCW 59.12.050. The proper terminology is that a party who files an action after improper notice may not maintain such action or avail itself of the superior court's jurisdiction. See Nickum v. City of Bainbridge Island, 153 Wash.App. 366, 379 n. 9, 223 P.3d 1172 (2009). Here, we characterize the parties' arguments regarding jurisdiction accordingly.

¶ 16 Notwithstanding Kirby, we endorse and adopt the approach taken in Tacoma Rescue Mission. Kirby cited our Supreme Court's decision in Christensen for the proposition that noncompliance with statutory procedures prevents *375 the superior court from “acquiring” subject matter jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer proceeding. Kirby, 154 Wash.App. at 850, 226 P.3d 222. What the Supreme Court actually said in Christensen is that noncompliance with the statutory method of process precludes the superior court from “exercising” subject matter jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer proceeding. Christensen, 162 Wash.2d at 372, 173 P.3d 228.

¶ 17 Kirby also quoted the Supreme Court's statement that in an unlawful detainer action, “the court sits as a special statutory tribunal to summarily decide the issues authorized by statute and not as a court of general jurisdiction with the power to hear and determine other issues.” Granat v. Keasler, 99 Wash.2d at 571, 663 P.2d 830. In Granat, the court explained that counterclaims could not be heard in an unlawful detainer action because of the legislature's intent “to create a summary procedure and limit the issue to the landlord's right of possession.” Granat, 99 Wash.2d at 570–71, 663 P.2d 830. The court used the word “jurisdiction” to refer to statutory limitations on a court's authority to let an unlawful detainer action go forward. The court did not purport to hold that the unlawful detainer statutes define procedures through which the court acquires subject matter jurisdiction.
