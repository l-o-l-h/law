* Introduction
Evidence law does not determine which party has a "burden of proof"
with respect to a particular issue, nor is the /level/ of that burden a
function of the types of rules we normally associate with "evidence
law".

The same can be said of presumptions, which concerns not particular
classed of evidence, but the effect certain evidence is to have if
certain conditions are satisfied.

** Understandings
One must approach the subject with at least three understandings:
1. courts often describe issues involving burdens of proof and
   presumptions using variable and ill-defnied terms;
2. courts often use the same term to mean different things and do not
   indicate clearly which meaning is intended in a particular context;
   and
3. even where courts have reached consensus about the meaning of
   certain terms, some key unresolved questions remain.


With these admonitions, we approach this chapter with the modest goals
of setting forth some basic principles and pointing out where some of
the land mines are buried.
