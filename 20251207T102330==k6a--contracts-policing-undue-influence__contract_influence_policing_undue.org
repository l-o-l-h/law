* Presumption of Undue Influence

In  certain  relationships,  there  will be  a  presumption  of  undue
influence that the defendant has the burden of overcoming.  This means
that once the plaintiff presents certain facts, the presumption is one
of  undue  influence and  the  contract  is presumptively  void.   The
defendant then has  to show that there was no  undue influence and the
bargain was fair to the plaintiff.
