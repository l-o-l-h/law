* RCW 59.18.380 Forcible entry or detainer or unlawful detainer actions—Writ of restitution—Answer—Order—Stay—Bond.

- At the time and place fixed  for the hearing of plaintiff's motion for a writ of  restitution,
  - the defendant,
    - or any person  in possession
    - or claiming possession of the property,
  - may answer,
    - orally
    - or in writing,
  - and assert
    - any
      - legal
      - or equitable
      - defense
      - or set-off
      - arising  out of the tenancy.

  - If the  answer is  oral
    - the  substance thereof  shall be endorsed on  the complaint by the  court.

- The court shall  examine
  - the parties
  - and witnesses
  - orally
    - to  ascertain the merits of the complaint and answer,

  - and if it shall appear that
    - the plaintiff has the right to be restored  to possession of the  property,
  - the court _shall_  enter an *order*
    - directing the issuance of  a writ of restitution,
      - returnable ten days  after its  date,
    - restoring  to the  plaintiff possession  of the property

  - and  if it  shall  appear  to the  court  that
    - there is  no substantial issue of material fact
    - of the right of the plaintiff
    - to be granted
      - other relief  as prayed for in the complaint
      - and provided for in this chapter,
    - the court _may_ enter an *order and judgment*
      - granting so much of such relief as may be sustained by the proof,

  - and the court _may_ grant
    - such other relief as  may be prayed for  in the plaintiff's complaint and provided for in this chapter,

  - then the court _shall_ enter an *order denying*
    - any relief sought  by the  plaintiff
    - for  which the court has  determined that
      - the plaintiff  has no right as  a matter of law:

  - PROVIDED,

    - That
      - within three days
      - after the service of the writ of restitution
      - issued prior  to final judgment,
    - the  defendant,
      - or person in possession of the property,
    - may,
      - in any action
      - for the recovery of possession of the property
      - for failure to pay rent,
    - stay the execution of the  writ pending  final judgment
      - by paying into  court or  to the plaintiff, as  the court  directs,
      - all  rent found to  be due,
    - and in addition
    - by paying,
      - on a  monthly basis  pending final  judgment,
      - an amount equal  to the monthly  rent
      - called for  by the lease  or rental agreement
      - at the time the  complaint was filed:

  - PROVIDED FURTHER,

    - That before  any writ  shall issue  prior to  final judgment
    - the plaintiff shall
      - execute to  the defendant
      - and file  in the court
    - a  bond
      - in such sum as the  court may order,
      - with sufficient surety  to be approved by the clerk,
      - conditioned that
        - the  plaintiff will prosecute his  or her action without delay,
        - and will pay all costs that  may be adjudged to the defendant,
        - and  all damages which he or she  may sustain by reason of the  writ of  restitution having  been issued,
        - should the  same be wrongfully sued out.

  - The court _shall_ also
    - enter an order
    - directing the parties to proceed  to trial
    - on the complaint and  answer in the usual manner.

- If it appears to the court
  - that the plaintiff should not be restored to possession of the property,
  - the court shall deny plaintiff's motion for a writ of restitution
  - and enter an order directing the parties to proceed to trial within thirty days on the complaint and answer.

- If it appears to the court
  - that there is a substantial issue of material fact
  - as to whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to other relief
    - as is prayed for in plaintiff's complaint and provided for in this chapter,
  - or that there is a genuine issue of a material fact
    - pertaining to a legal or equitable defense or set-off raised in the defendant's answer,
    - the court shall grant or deny so much of plaintiff's other relief sought
    - and so much of defendant's defenses or set-off claimed, as may be proper.
