A possibility in defending a prima facie case is to find that the disadvanted party was the victim of undue influence.  A contract is *voidable* by the victim if that party was unfairly persuaded by another whom he or she was justified, by virtue of their relationship, in assuming would act in a manner consistent with his or her welfare.

See Restatement, Second, §177.

In one case the court refused to grant specific performance to the doctor, saying that there was a presumption of undue influence of the doctor-patient relationship, and it had not been rebutted.
