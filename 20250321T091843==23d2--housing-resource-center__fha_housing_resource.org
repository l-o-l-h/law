Subject: HUD website expected to be down starting Monday

I was just on the bi-weekly CHCDF call, and someone heard that HUD's website may be down starting next Monday for an indefinite period of time. A couple folks mentioned they have been pulling down data. National Housing Conference has a page where they collecting things: https://hrc.nhc.org/resources/types/policy-resources/recovered-government-resource/
