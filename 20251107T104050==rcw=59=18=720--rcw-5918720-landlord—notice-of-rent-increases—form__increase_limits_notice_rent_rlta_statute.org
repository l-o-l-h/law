periodic  charges  identified in  the  rental  agreement for  use  and
occupancy of  your rental  unit once  every 12 months  by up  to seven
percent plus consumer  price index, or 10 percent,  whichever is less,
as allowed  by RCW 59.18.700. Your  landlord is not required  to raise
the rent or other recurring or periodic charges by any amount.

(2) Your landlord  may be exempt from the limit  on increases for rent
and other recurring  or periodic charges for the  reasons described in
RCW 59.18.710. If your landlord  claims an exemption, your landlord is

  issued on (insert  date), which is 12 or less  years before the date

  low-income housing  development as  defined in RCW  82.45.010, where
  the  property  is  owned  by  a  public  housing  authority,  public
  development authority, or nonprofit organization. (The landlord must
  include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

- [ ] You live in a qualified low-income housing development which was
  allocated federal  low-income housing tax credits  by the Washington
  state  housing  finance  commission  and  there  is  an  enforceable
  regulatory  agreement  under  the   low-income  housing  tax  credit
  program.   (The  landlord must  include  facts  or attach  documents
  supporting the exemption.)

- [ ]  You live in a  dwelling unit in  which you share a  bathroom or
  kitchen facility with the owner, and the owner maintains a principal
  residence  at  the residential  real  property.  (The landlord  must
  include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

- [ ]  You live in  a single-family owner-occupied residence  in which
  the  owner-occupant  rents or  leases  no  more  than two  units  or
  bedrooms  including, but  not limited  to, an  attached or  detached
  accessory dwelling unit. (The landlord  must include facts or attach
  documents supporting the exemption.)

- [ ] You  live in a duplex,  triplex, or fourplex in  which the owner
