* Columbia Val. Credit Exch., Inc. v. Lampson, 12 Wn. App. 952, 533 P.2d 152 (1975)

Where allegations of complaint totalled $1,596.25 but prayer of complaint was for $3,328.20, allegations of complaint provided defendant with sufficient notice to support default judgment against him in amount of allegations but to extent judgment exceeded that amount it was void.


In the instant case the allegations of the complaint total $1,596.25, but the prayer of the complaint was for $3,328.20. We hold that the allegations of the complaint provided defendant with sufficient notice to support a default judgment against him in the amount of these allegations, I.e., $1,596.25; however, to the extent the judgment exceeded that amount it is void.
