** 8 Summary Judgment -- 368Hk278(2) Motion to dismiss

Trial court in former tenants' forcible entry and detainer action was required to treat landlord's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as motion for summary judgment and give tenants a reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to summary judgment motion, where landlord presented, and court did not exclude, a declaration that presented matters outside the pleading, including factual assertions regarding tenants' purported intent to abandon the property. Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b), 12(b)(6), 56.
