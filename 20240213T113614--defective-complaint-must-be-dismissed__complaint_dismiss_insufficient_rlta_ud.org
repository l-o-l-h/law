* A Complaint that is Defective Must Be Dismissed (No Right to Amend)

Mr. Hernandez also contends dismissal is an inappropriate remedy
because Ms. France did not expressly move for dismissal at the show
cause hearing.

But a party may always raise their opponent’s “failure to establish
facts upon which relief can be granted” for the first time on
appeal. RAP 2.5(a)(2).

And here, dismissal is the proper remedy for that error.
- See Brewer, 25 Wn. App. 2d at 858;
- see also Sundholm, 62 Wn.2d at 246-47 (holding, where plaintiff was
  “not entitled to the relief sought” in their complaint, “the only
  alternative available” to the court was to dismiss the complaint
  with prejudice).
