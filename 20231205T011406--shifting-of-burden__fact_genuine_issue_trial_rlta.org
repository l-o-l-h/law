It is insufficient to simply claim without any reference to the record
that the court effectively just got it wrong.  _Welch v. Brand
Insulations, Inc._, 27 Wn. App. 2d 110, 115 (2023) ("If the moving
party satisfies its burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving
party to 'set forth specific facts evidencing a genuine issue of
material fact for trial.'") (quoting _Schaaf v. Highfield_, 127 Wn.2d
17, 21 (1995)).

Because Nolan cites to nothing in the record creating a genuine issue
of material fact as to the events which led to the landlord seeking
eviction or the tenant's defenses, the trial court did not err by
declining to grant a trial.  _Welch_ at 117 (summary judgment is
appropriate "if, from all the evidence, a reasonable person could
reach only one conclusion.") (quoting _Folsom v. Burger King_, 135 Wn.3d
658 663 (1998)).
