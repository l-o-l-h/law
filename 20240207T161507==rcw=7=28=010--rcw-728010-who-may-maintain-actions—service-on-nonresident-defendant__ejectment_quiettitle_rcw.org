  - a right to the possession thereof,
- may recover the same
  - by action in the superior court of the proper county,
  - to be brought against
    - the tenant in possession;
    - if there is no such tenant, then
    - against the person claiming the title or some interest therein,
- and may have judgment in such action
  - quieting or removing a cloud from plaintiff's title;


** Quiet Title Action
- an action to quiet title
  - may be brought by
    - the known heirs
      - of any deceased person, or
      - of any person presumed in law to be deceased, or
      - by the successors in interest of such known heirs
    - against
      - the unknown heirs of such deceased person or
      - against such person presumed to be deceased and his or her
        unknown heirs, and
  - if it shall be made to appear in such action that
    - the plaintiffs are heirs of the deceased person, or the person
      presumed in law to be deceased, or the successors in interest of
      such heirs, and
    - have been in possession of the real property involved in such
      action for ten years preceding the time of the commencement of
      such action, and
    - that during said time
      - no person other than the plaintiff in the action or his or her
        grantors
      - has claimed or asserted any right or title or interest in said
        property,
  - the court may
    - adjudge and decree
    - the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action
    - to be the owners of such real property, free from all claims of
      any unknown heirs of such deceased person, or person presumed in
      law to be deceased;

- and an action to quiet title
  - may be maintained by any person in the actual possession of real
    property
  - against the unknown heirs of a person known to be dead, or
  - against any person
  - where it is not known whether such person is dead or not, and
  - against the unknown heirs of such person, and
  - if it shall thereafter transpire that such person was at the time
    of commencing such action dead the judgment or decree in such
    action shall be as binding and conclusive on the heirs of such
    person as though they had been known and named;
- and in all actions, under this section, to quiet or remove a cloud
  from the title to real property,
  - if the defendant be absent or a nonresident of this state, or
  - cannot, after due diligence, be found within the state, or
  - conceals himself or herself to avoid the service of summons,
- service may be made upon such defendant by publication of summons
  as provided by law;
- and the court may appoint a trustee for such absent or nonresident
  defendant,
  - to make or cancel any deed or conveyance of whatsoever nature, or
  - do any other act to carry into effect the judgment or the decree
    of the court.
