Even if a landlord obtains preliminary success through a writ of
restitution, trial on the right of possession must be ordered if the
tenant raises genuine issues of material fact pertaining to a defense
or set-off.  RCW 59.18.380.  "This is nearly the identical language
that governs summary judgment."  _Kiemle & Hagood Co. v. Daniels_, 26
Wn. App. 2d 199, 215, 218 (2023) (citing CR 56(c)).
