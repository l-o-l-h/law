* Origin of Right of Set-Off

Again, in /United States v. Cantrall (C.C.)/ 176 F. 949, it was said: ‘A
set-off is a creation of the statute, and did not exist at common law.

/Fisher Flouring Mills Co. v. United States/, 17 F.2d 232, 235 (9th Cir. 1927)


The  right to  set-off  is  wholly statutory,  and  in  this case  its
existence and  its definition must  depend upon the provisions  of the
statutes of the state of Washington.  The Code of Washington (2 Hill's
Code, Sec. 806)

/Harrisburg Tr. Co. v. Shufeldt/, 87 F. 669, 670 (9th Cir. 1898)

[Perhaps set-off is a creation of equity?]


The Legal  Adjustment Bureau Case  was an action  at law in  which the
defendant sought to set up a demand in his favor which had been barred
by the statute before the action was commenced. The statute considered
was  Rem.  Rev.  Stat.   § 266,  relating to  *set-offs*  in actions  at
law. That section, in effect,  provides that, to constitute a set-off,
a cause  of action in  favor of the pleader  must have existed  at the
time the  action against him was  commenced, or, in *421  other words,
*the defense of set-off*  is in _the nature of a  plea in confession and
avoidance_ and amounts to the bringing  forward of one right of action
against another to  the end that one shall cancel  the other, in whole
or   in   part,    and   that   both   shall    be   adjudicated   and
satisfied. Consequently, it is essential,  under the statute, that the
set-off must be one upon which a  cause of action exists when the suit
is commenced.  The  Legal Adjustment Bureau Case so  holds and nothing
more,  and therefore  it  has  no bearing  upon  the  question of  the
equitable right of retainer here asserted.

/In re Smith's Estate/, 179 Wash. 417, 420–21, 38 P.2d 244, 245 (1934)

* Same Transaction

In  addition, we  note that  in  University Medical  Center the  Third
Circuit  applied  a  more  narrow   definition  of  the  phrase  “same
transaction” than  was applied  by the district  court in  the present
case. The court explained its reasons for doing so as follows:

#+begin_quote
We  find that  the open-ended  standard,  endorsed in  the context  of
discerning  compulsory counterclaims,  is  inadequate for  determining
whether two claims arise from the same transaction for the purposes of
equitable recoupment in bankruptcy.

Indeed, in  [Lee v. Schweiker, 739  F.2d 870, 875 (3rd  Cir.1984) ] we
stressed that *both setoff and recoupment play very different roles in
bankruptcy than  in their original  roles as rules of  pleading.* Lee,
739 F.2d at 875.

For the  purposes of  recoupment, a mere  logical relationship  is not
enough: The  fact that the same  two parties are involved,  and that a
similar subject matter gave rise to both claims ... does not mean that
the two  arose from  the “same transaction.”  Rather, both  debts must
arise out of  a single integrated transaction so that  it would not be
inequitable for the  debtor to enjoy the benefits  of that transaction
without meeting  its obligations.  Use of  this stricter  standard for
delineating the bounds  of a transaction in the  context of recoupment
is  in   accord  with   the  principle  that   this  doctrine,   as  a
non-statutory, equitable  exception to  the automatic stay,  should be
narrowly  construed.   Id.  at  1081  (internal  quotation  marks  and
citation omitted).

* Washington Law Statutes for Set-Offs

Washington law governs set-off through various statutes, primarily

- RCW 4.56.060  for   general  civil  judgments  and
- RCW  62A.9A (Uniform  Commercial Code  Article 9)  for bank  deposit
  set-offs,
- alongside specific rules in  RCW 12.08.120 for justice  courts,
- all  establishing procedures  and  limitations  on deducting  mutual
  debts, with set-off being an  equitable right often requiring proper
  pleading.
- The Code of Washington (2 Hill's Code, Sec. 806)

* Basic Definition of Setoff-Offset

“The right of  setoff (also called ‘offset’) allows  entities that owe
each  other money  to apply  their  *mutual* debts  against each  other,
thereby avoiding ‘the  absurdity of making A  pay B when B  owes A.’ ”
/Citizens  Bank  of  Maryland  v.  Strumpf/,  516  U.S.  16,  ––––,  116
S.Ct.  286,  289,  133  L.Ed.2d 258  (1995)  (citation  omitted).  The
defining characteristic of  setoff is that “the mutual  debt and claim
...  are  generally  those  arising from  different  transactions.”  4
Collier on  Bankruptcy ¶ 553.03,  at 553–14 (15th ed.  1995) (“Collier
”).

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1398 (9th Cir. 1996)

* Set-Off vs. Counterclaim

On the technical question as to whether a counterclaim could have been
pleaded in  this action, we are  aware that there is  some conflict of
authority on  the proposition generally; but  it seems to us  that our
*statute* is so plain and explicit that construction cannot be invoked.

/Sheafe v. Hastie/, 16 Wash. 563, 566, 48 P. 246, 247 (1897)


And  if it  is to  be  construed as  a  *set-off*, then  _section 806_  is
controlling, which provides that the  defendant in a civil action upon
a  contract expressed  or implied  may set  off any  demand of  a like
nature against the plaintiff in interest which existed and belonged to
him at the time of the commencement  of the suit.

_There  seems  to be  no  real  difference between  counterclaims  and
set-offs_,  so  far  as  the  statute  is  concerned,

excepting  that  technically there  is  _a  difference in  degree_,

- the set-off amounting only to a set-off or balance of the claim sued
  upon, or some portion thereof, and

- the  counterclaim comprehending  a set-off  and an  additional claim
  which would warrant a judgment over in favor of the defendant, if it
  were established; and,

- whatever  conflict  of  authority  there  may  be,  this  court  has
  established the right of the  defendant to a set-off or counterclaim
  _where the claim is unliquidated_, as  in the case at bar, in /Shelton
  v.  Conant/,  10 Wash.  193, 38  Pac. 1013, where it  was held that,
  under  Code Proc.   § 195,  in an  action arising  on contract,  the
  defendant could  counterclaim for  any cause  of action  against the
  plaintiff arising on contract, whether liquidated or not.

/Sheafe v. Hastie/, 16 Wash. 563, 567, 48 P. 246, 247 (1897)

* The Right of Setoff

** 11 U.S.C. § Section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code

“Except as otherwise provided ... this title does not affect any right
of a creditor  to offset a mutual  debt owing by such  creditor to the
debtor that  arose before the commencement  of the case ...  against a
claim  of such  creditor  against  the debtor  that  arose before  the
commencement of the case....”

** Common Law Right

Section 553 “is not an independent  source of law governing setoff; it
is  generally understood  as  a legislative  attempt  to preserve  the
*common-law right of setoff* arising  out of non-bankruptcy law.” /United
States v. Arkison  (In re Cascade Roads, Inc.)/, 34  F.3d 756, 763 (9th
Cir.1994) (quoting  /United States  v.  Norton/, 717  F.2d 767,  772 (3d
Cir.1983)).

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1398 (9th Cir. 1996)

** The Mutuality Requirement

In order for countervailing debts to be *“mutual,”* they must be “in the
same  right  and  between  the  same parties,  standing  in  the  same
capacity.”    Collier  ¶   553.04[2],   at   553–22  (citing   /England
v. Industrial Comm. of Utah (In  re Visiting Home Services, Inc.)/, 643
F.2d 1356, 1360 (9th Cir.1981)).  The mutuality requirement stems from
section 553(a)'s  reference to “a mutual  debt” owed by a  creditor to
the debtor against  the creditor's claim against the  debtor,10 and it
is strictly construed.

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1398–99 (9th Cir. 1996)

* Characteristics of Setoff-Offset

** Discretionary Permissive and Equitable in Nature--Not Mandatory

The  right of  setoff is  permissive, not  mandatory; its  application
“rests  in  the  discretion  of  [the]  court,  which  exercises  such
discretion under the  general principles of [equity].”  /In re Cascade
Roads/,  34  F.3d  at  763  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation
omitted); Collier ¶ 553.02, at 533–13 (citation omitted).

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1399 (9th Cir. 1996)

** Burden of Proving Setoff On the Party Asserting the Right

“The burden of  proving an enforceable right of setoff  rests with the
party asserting the right.” /In re County of Orange/, 183 B.R. at 615.

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1399 (9th Cir. 1996)

** Garnishee Can Raise Defense of Set-Off to Garnishment

Garnishee defendant  can answer that  he is not indebted  to principal
defendant, where he is entitled  to setoff against principal defendant
in amount  greater than his  indebtedness. /Parks v. Lepley/  (1931) 160
Wash. 287, 294 P. 1020.

Corporation to  whom debtor had loaned  money less than amount  of his
debt may  credit amount  of loan and  offset debt  against garnishment
notwithstanding that  bank's claim had  been assigned to  third person
for collection. /Austin v. Wallace/ (1921) 117 Wash. 61, 200 P. 566

* Recoupment Doctrine -- Same Transaction rather than Mutual Obligations

Recoupment  “is the  setting  up of  a demand  arising  from the  *same
transaction* as the plaintiff's claim  or cause of action, strictly for
the  purpose of  abatement  or  reduction of  such  claim.” Collier  ¶
553.03,  at  553–15  (emphasis  in  original).   Under  recoupment,  a
defendant is able  to meet a plaintiff's claim  “with a countervailing
claim that arose  ‘out of the same transaction.’   ” /Ashland Petroleum
Co. v. Appel (In re B & L  Oil Co.)/, 782 F.2d 155, 157 (10th Cir.1986)
(citations omitted).  For this  reason, recoupment has been analogized
to both compulsory counterclaims  and affirmative defenses. See, e.g.,
/In  re California  Canners  and Growers/,  62 B.R.   18,  22 (9th  Cir.
BAP 1986) (Elliott, Bankruptcy J., concurring) (citation omitted).

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1399 (9th Cir. 1996)

** Recoupment for Overpayments -- Equity

As noted above, recoupment is an  *equitable doctrine* which is based on
the  premise that  “the  defendant  should be  entitled  to show  that
because of matters  arising out of the transaction sued  on, he or she
is not liable in full for the plaintiff's claim.” Collier ¶ 553.03, at
553–17 (citation omitted). There are, of course, any number of reasons
why a defendant  may not in fact  be liable in full  for a plaintiff's
claim. In  the cases cited by  the appellants, the defendant  had made
certain payments to the debtor,  and recoupment was allowed because it
would  be inequitable  not  to  allow the  defendant  to recoup  those
payments against the debtor's subsequent claim.

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1401 (9th Cir. 1996)

** Same Transaction Principle -- Logical Relationship Test

In  deciding  whether   the  relevant  claims  arose   from  the  *same
transaction*,  the district  court applied  the “logical  relationship”
test  outlined by  the  Supreme Court  in /Moore  v.   New York  Cotton
Exchange/,  270 U.S.   593, 46  S.Ct. 367,  70 L.Ed.   750 (1926).   In
/Moore/, the Court  stated that “ ‘[t]ransaction’ is a  word of flexible
meaning. It may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not
so  much upon  the immediateness  of  their connection  as upon  their
logical relationship.” Id., 270 U.S. at 610, 46 S.Ct. at 371; see also
/Albright v. Gates/, 362 F.2d 928, 929 (9th Cir.1966) (“In deciding what
is a  transaction, we  take note  that the  term gets  an increasingly
liberal  construction.”).   Applying  this test,  the  district  court
accepted Fireman's Fund's argument  that, because of the incorporation
of the  General Indemnity Agreement  into the June 4,  1987 Agreement,
both claims arose from the latter agreement.

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1402 (9th Cir. 1996)

The district court's decision is supported by Arizona contract law. As
the Arizona Supreme Court has explained,

#+begin_quote
[m]atters contained in other writings which  are referred to are to be
regarded as part of the contract  and properly to be considered in the
interpretation of the contract.... [I]t has long been settled, without
a dissenting  voice, that parties  may incorporate into  agreements by
mere reference, other  writings or agreements or  records, and thereby
make the latter an essential part of the contract.
#+end_quote

/Climate Control, Inc. v. Hill/, 86  Ariz. 180, 342 P.2d 854, 859 (1959)
(emphasis added),  modified on reh'g  on other grounds, 87  Ariz. 201,
349 P.2d 771, appeal dismissed, 364  U.S. 409, 81 S.Ct. 180, 5 L.Ed.2d
185 (1960).  Accordingly,  under Arizona law the  incorporation of the
General Indemnity Agreement  into the June 4, 1987  agreement made the
former  “an   essential  part”  of   the  latter  contract,   and  the
countervailing claims thus each arose from that contract.

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1402 (9th Cir. 1996)

** Independent Accounting

the court pointed out that  each transaction was subject to individual
accounting.

/Newbery Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co./, 95 F.3d 1392, 1402 (9th Cir. 1996)
