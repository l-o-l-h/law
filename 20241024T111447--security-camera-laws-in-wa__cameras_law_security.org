* Can a Landlord Install Security Cameras

** Can I install security cameras on my rental property?
Yes, you can install security cameras on your rental property as the
property owner. Unfortunately, this one gets complicated since there
is no definitive legal framework to justify landlordsâ€™ legality in
installing security cameras on rental properties.

However, as the landlord, you can justify installing security cameras
to protect your property and ensure the safety of your tenants. Also,
they have to submit legal requirements and comply with security camera
installation and video monitoring laws.
